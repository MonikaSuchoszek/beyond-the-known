Varenna was our first destination that day, one of the top rated towns on the shores of Lake Como. Immediately after arriving we noticed a really long queue in front of the ferry. The first thing we did was buying a tickets and actually getting some information about the ferry schedule which was very difficult to find online.

We didn't know exactly what to see in this town. I just noticed on [MAPS.ME](https://maps.me/) (our favorite app with off line maps) a castle above and thought it's going to be a nice view from there. It was ... just look at the pictures below.

Colorful houses, narrow streets, lots of flowers, breathtaking view from the castle...the beauty of this town charmed us! :)

We took a ferry to Bellagio, probably the most famous town at the shore of Como Lake. This one is famous because of....expensive shops which you can easily find here, art galleries :p
