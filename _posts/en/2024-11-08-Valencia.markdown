We paired our stay in Platja de Gandia with a one-day trip to Oceanogràfic, an 
oceanarium located within the stunning Gardens of Turia in the heart of Valencia. More details on how we traveled there 
can be found in the practical section at the end of this post.

If you're looking for an unforgettable experience with marine life, Oceanogràfic in Valencia should be at the top of your list. As 
the largest aquarium in Europe, it’s the kind of place where you can easily spend an entire day. From dolphins and 
beluga whales to sharks, penguins, turtles, and an incredible variety of fish, this destination captivates visitors of 
all ages while promoting sustainability and environmental awareness.

With so much to explore, plan to spend at least 4–5 hours (or more) to fully enjoy everything. The park is cleverly 
divided into zones, each representing different marine habitats from around the world. One of the standout features is 
the underwater tunnels, where you’re surrounded by breathtaking views of sharks and rays gliding gracefully overhead. 
These tunnels are pure magic but can get crowded since they are one-way only.

A personal highlight? The beluga whales. These charming creatures are as adorable as you can imagine and an absolute must-see.
Oceanogràfic rescued two belugas from the horrors of the war in Ukraine in June of this year. It is the only facility on 
the continent that houses belugas and was able to assist with this very challenging rescue operation. Currently, the new 
belugas are undergoing recovery and acclimation in separate areas that are not accessible or viewable by the public.

The jellyfish tanks were almost hypnotizing visitors with their graceful, harmonic movements. While 
there’s no shortage of fascinating animals, don’t be surprised if some exhibits, like the crocodiles, are a bit 
underwhelming—we only managed to spot one during our visit.

For families with kids, the dolphin show is the star attraction. There are typically three shows per day, and we 
recommend arriving at least 20–25 minutes early to secure good seats. For us, this was enough time, but some reviews 
mention that the shows can fill up even with that much time in advance. The show itself lasts less than 20 minutes and 
is both fun and educational, with English subtitles on a big screen for 
non-Spanish speakers. Watching the trainers interact with these intelligent creatures was a delight, and the focus on 
environmental issues rather than elaborate tricks made it all the more meaningful.

Pick up a map at the reception near the entrance—it’ll save you time and make exploring easier. The layout is intuitive, 
but there is a lot to see, and a map ensures you don’t miss any of the highlights. Additionally, you can enter the 
underground aquariums in one place and exit in a completely different part of the park, which left us a bit confused and 
disoriented at times. If your toddler uses a pram, you’ll need to locate elevators for each underground zone and leave 
it in a small designated storage area while attending the dolphin show.

Oceanogràfic has a variety of food stands and restaurants (most with poor reviews), but be prepared for 
higher-than-average prices. While the no-outside-food policy might seem strict, many visitors managed to sneak in some 
snacks. Alternatively, bring sandwiches and enjoy them before entering the park—this was our strategy, and it worked 
perfectly (though we still had small snacks inside, not entirely following the rule). Once inside, vending machines 
with drinks are convenient for a quick refresh. If you’re looking for a special treat, the submarine restaurant offers 
a unique dining experience, but be sure to book ahead as it fills up quickly.

After our long visit to Oceanogràfic, we only managed to walk back to the train station on foot, admiring along the way 
the beautiful Turia Gardens, which now stretch more than 8 km and were developed on the dry riverbed of the Turia 
River. The row of uniquely designed buildings—including the Science Museum, Art Center, and IMAX Theater—is stunning!

The Science Museum is particularly well-known, but we would have needed another day to visit it, and it might not be 
the best choice for our almost-three-year-old toddler. The Art Palace of Queen Sofia is Valencia’s Royal Opera House 
and also a venue for music, ballet, and theater performances. It can be visited with a guided tour.

Visiting the rest of the city was something we saved for the last day before our flight back to Belgium. We booked one 
night in the city center, close to the Turia metro station, so we could easily reach the airport early the next morning. 
After dropping off our luggage at the apartment, we headed straight to the city center.  

Our first stop was the spectacular food market, **Mercat Central de València**. This beautiful market offers a diverse 
selection of food—meats, seafood, baked goods, spices, and cheese—as well as ready-to-eat meals and drinks, allowing 
you to enjoy your food right there. Opened in 1928, it features a unique blend of iron, glass, and ceramics, with its 
central dome reaching nearly 30 meters high! It’s definitely worth a visit.

Just opposite the market, you’ll find the Silk Exchange (La Lonja de la Seda), the historic marketplace that once 
thrived during Valencia's booming silk trade. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it showcases stunning late 
Gothic architecture. Although we didn’t visit it ourselves, our friends highly recommended it, highlighting the 
beautiful ceiling and the twisting columns in the grand hall as standout features. There’s also a charming courtyard 
with a small garden of orange trees at its center.

<img src="/assets/Spain/Valencia/20240830_125002.jpg" />

Our next stop was Plaça de l'Ajuntament, home to Valencia’s City Hall, the Main Post Office, and several historic, 
beautiful banks. This square is a popular meeting point for both locals and tourists, as it serves as a hub for many 
bus routes. Flower stalls and a fountain add extra charm to this large, lively space.

<img src="/assets/Spain/Valencia/20240830_133019.jpg" />

Heading toward the main cathedral, we passed an intriguing building that turned out to be the **Museu Nacional de 
Ceràmica i de les Arts Sumptuàries González Martí**, home to a vast collection of ceramics and artworks. Its stunning 
Baroque facade immediately caught our attention. Although we didn’t have time to explore the interior, it appears to 
be budget-friendly, offering free entry on weekends and discounts for certain visitors. With excellent reviews, 
it seems well worth a visit.

<img src="/assets/Spain/Valencia/20240830_134351.jpg" />

We were pleasantly surprised upon reaching Plaça de la Reina to discover misting water sprays that offered a refreshing 
cool-down on hot days. Situated right next to the iconic Valencia Cathedral, the square has been recently renovated 
and is surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and shops, making it a perfect spot to grab a bite or enjoy a drink.

The Valencia Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of the Holy Chalice, is one of the city's most iconic landmarks. 
Most visitors come to see the cup believed to have been used by Jesus at the Last Supper, which is kept in a dedicated 
chapel. Various architectural styles can be observed, a result of its long history of renovations since construction 
began in the 13th century.

The Túria Fountain on Plaza de la Virgen, located right in front of the Basilica de la Mare de Déu, is a clear 
representation of the Túria River. The fountain features eight sculptures of women, symbolizing the eight main 
irrigation canals (acequias) that distribute water from the Túria to the surrounding fields. The square itself is 
stunning, surrounded by historic buildings, including the Basilica and the nearby Valencia Cathedral. Its vibrant 
atmosphere and rich history make it a must-visit spot in the heart of the city.

If you’re searching for a peaceful escape from Valencia’s busy city center and the scorching afternoon sun, the Botanical 
Garden (Jardí Botànic) is the perfect oasis. Tucked away like a hidden gem yet still within walking distance, this 
tranquil park offers a refreshing change of scenery and a chance to reconnect with nature in the heart of the city.

During our late-August visit, the garden wasn’t bursting with blooms, but it still showcased an incredible variety of 
plants, ranging from towering trees to delicate succulents. The old arboretum is another standout feature—its tall 
trees, planted decades ago, have grown to enormous sizes, with some even piercing through the roofs of nearby 
structures. Walking through this area feels like stepping into a magical forest. This spot is perfect for escaping 
Valencia’s summer heat. With plenty of shaded seating areas beneath sprawling tree 
canopies, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the calm.

I'm writing this blog post after the catastrophic floods that hit the eastern Spanish region of Valencia at the end of 
October. It’s truly heartbreaking to see pictures and videos of people trapped in vehicles, buildings, and underground 
parking garages, caught completely off guard as the streets were transformed into rivers within moments. The root of this 
devastating event was a record-breaking downfall: a year’s worth of rain unleashed in just eight hours. When I visited 
Valencia a few months ago, the thought of such a disaster never even crossed my mind. The city seemed so 
vibrant, sunny, and resilient. Yet, nature had other plans, and I now realize how unpredictable things can be. This tragedy 
underscores the growing impact of climate change, with extreme weather events becoming alarmingly more 
frequent and intense. One can only hope that authorities will take this as a call to action, improving early-warning 
systems to prevent such a loss of life in the future. The destruction went beyond human tragedy, with infrastructure, 
bridges, and public buildings heavily damaged, leaving scars that will take years to repair.  

__Practical info:__

* If you're arriving at Valencia's Airport (Aeroport), it’s an easy trip to the city center. Metro lines 3 and 5 will take you from Aeroport to North Station (Xàtiva) in just 21 minutes, covering Zone AB+. The fare is €5.80 per person.

* We’ve already described how to get from Valencia to Platja de Gandia—you can find the details in a [previous post]({% post_url en/2024-10-05-Gandia_Cullera %}). From the North Train Station (near the Xàtiva metro stop), we took the metro to Ayora and then walked about 2 km on foot. It wasn’t the fastest way to get to the Oceanarium, but we enjoyed the walk nonetheless. For a more convenient option, the tram stops right in front of the Oceanarium and takes around 15 minutes to reach the city center. It might be a better alternative for those who prefer a quicker journey.

* Children under 10 may travel free of charge when accompanied by an adult with a valid transport ticket. [SUMA 10 for 10 rides](https://www.miivomobility.com/en/blog/Tarjeta-SUMA-ventajas) Zona A - €8, currently €4 due to a discount (single ticket €1.50 in Zone A). It can be used to make up to 15 simultaneous trips by people traveling together.  
  Note: The temporary partial reduction of 50% applies to SUMA 10, SUMA Monthly, SUMA Monthly Jove, TuiN tickets, and temporary Metrovalencia season tickets until January 31, 2025. We bought a SUMA 10 card and used it for all four of us, which was considerably cheaper than buying single metro tickets.

* [Oceanogràfic](https://oceanografic.experticket.com/en) - €34.70 per adult, booked online a few days in advance for a specific time slot. This means you will only be able to access the Oceanogràfic from the time selected during the purchase process, and you may stay in the aquarium until closing time. We bought tickets with a time slot at 10:00 a.m. and entered before 11:00, but there were people next to us who couldn’t enter with a ticket for the 12:00 slot, so it’s important to select your time wisely. Prices vary depending on the day, holiday week, etc. We took a train from Gandia as described in my other post, and then metro from Xàtiva to Ayora, with the last part on foot (almost 2 km).  
  **Pro Tip:** If you're visiting during peak summer months (July/August), plan to arrive right when the park opens at 10:00 a.m. The first dolphin show around 11:00 a.m. is less crowded, so it’s worth catching early in the day.

* La Lonja de la Seda de Valencia - €2 admission fee, quick visit (a few rooms and the main hall, small courtyard).

* [Botanical Garden](https://visit-cullera.es/guia/castillo-de-cullera/), entrance fee €3, free for babies and toddlers. If you're fast, you can be done in 30 minutes, but if you take your time, I would plan for 2 hours. It's a relatively small garden compared to others around the world, but definitely a must-see at a very cheap price! It wasn’t crowded during our Friday afternoon visit. Clean restrooms are available.
