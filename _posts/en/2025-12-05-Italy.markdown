This trip was one of my favourite ways of travelling: flying into a country and then continuing the journey by train straight 
from the airport. It is an incredibly convenient way to travel with kids, especially when train connections are good and 
distances are reasonable. Travelling along the coast by train allows you to stop in multiple cities without the need to 
rent a car, which significantly reduces transportation costs. It’s also ideal if you’re travelling with children who don’t 
enjoy long car rides or if you simply want to relax and not spend your holiday focused on driving. We’ve used this approach 
before in [Málaga]({% post_url en/2022-10-20-Benalmadena-Spain %}) and [Valencia]({% post_url en/2024-11-08-Valencia %}), and once again it worked perfectly. The only real downside is that you need to choose your 
destination carefully: train connections must be reliable, distances manageable, and attractions accessible without a car.

**Getting Around – Transportation Tips**

We flew from Brussels to Pisa Airport, which turned out to be surprisingly small and easy to navigate. After landing, we 
took a train called PisaMover to Pisa Centrale. This option was advertised as the fastest but it was also the most expensive. 
PisaMover is a high-speed shuttle running frequently between the airport and Pisa Centrale from 6:00 AM to midnight. Duration 
of the ride is only 5 minutes. Price: €6.50 adults / €4.50 children (each way).
Children under a certain age were said to travel free, but information was inconsistent. We paid €26 in total for the ride 
from the airport. At the ticket office, we were told our 4-year-old didn’t need a ticket, which contradicts the official 
website stating that all children require one. Considering the distance is under 2 km and easily walkable, PisaMover felt 
very expensive.
On our return day, we decided to check whether it was possible to walk to the airport instead. The distance was less than 
1.6 km from the city centre, and since we didn’t have much luggage, we gave it a try. It turned out to be a great decision: 
the walk was safe, easy, and took less than 30 minutes. Along the way, we even passed several cafés where we picked up 
pastries before reaching the airport. 

From the main train station in Pisa, we continued our journey to La Spezia where we stayed first 2 nights. We used regional
trains from [Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html). Afterwards, we moved to Marina di Massa for the rest of our stay. From there, we did a day 
trip to Pisa by train.

Train Tickets (Total Costs)
Pisa → La Spezia – €37.80 (€8.40 per adult / €4.20 per child)  
La Spezia → Massa Centro – €22.50 (€5.00 per adult / €2.50 per child)  
Massa Centro → Pisa – €27.90 (€6.40 per adult / €3.20 per child)  

Local Buses in Massa   
Total spent: €25.70   
•	Ticket price: €1.70 per ride   
•	Valid for 70 minutes after activation   
•	App-based ticketing available   

We installed the local bus app, created an account, and bought tickets directly using a credit card. You must remember to 
activate the ticket before boarding, which can be slightly confusing as the app is not fully translated into English. The 
first time, I asked another passenger for confirmation. After that, it was very easy to use. You can activate multiple 
tickets at once, which is very convenient when travelling as a group. Children under 1 metre in height travel for free. 
Our daughter (104 cm) did not have a ticket, and during a ticket inspection we were told it was fine. In practice, this 
rule seems difficult to enforce.

**Visiting Cinque Terre by combining ferry and train**

Instead of buying a full-day ferry ticket, we chose a one-way ferry ticket with intermediate stops and returned by train. 
This allowed us to spend more time in Monterosso and avoid a very long ferry ride back (up to 2 hours). The ferry was calm 
and quiet at first, but already in Riomaggiore it became extremely crowded. At one point, the ferry was so full that we 
had to split into two groups because there were no seats left. On board, only cold drinks and snacks were available, but 
the toilets were very useful when travelling with a child. The weather was beautiful and sunny, though quite windy, but 
still very pleasant for October. We were shocked by the crowds at Riomaggiore train station. The ferry felt busy, but 
the number of people on the platform was intense. We returned by train after 5 PM from Monterosso. The train was already crowded from Vernazza, so boarding in Monterosso 
was actually an advantage: we could easily find seats and enter with a pram. One downside of Italian trains is the toilets. 
There are usually only one or two per train, and often one is out of order. When the train is packed, reaching a working 
toilet with a child is very challenging.

**Our Ferry and Train Schedule** that allowed us to have enough time to explore each of the stops   
Ferry: La Spezia 09:15 → Porto Venere 10:00 (1h break)   
Ferry: Porto Venere 11:00 → Riomaggiore 11:35 (1h break)   
Ferry: Riomaggiore 12:35 → Vernazza 13:10 (2h break)   
Ferry: Vernazza 15:10 → Monterosso 15:30   
Train: Monterosso → La Spezia (25 min). We could have also stopped in Manarola and taken the next train from there to 
La Spezia, but we were simply too tired.

One-day roundtrip ticket Cinque Terre (€42 per adult / €15 per child)   
One-way ticket with intermediate stops (€30 per adult / €15 per child)   

We visited Cinque Terre at the very end of the ferry season. Ferries run from late March until November 1, with reduced frequency 
until early December. More information about the prices and current schedule [here](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/boat-excursions).

**Cinque Terre Express** trains connect Levanto, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, Riomaggiore, and La Spezia. They 
run frequently from early morning until late evening. Tickets can be bought at stations, from ticket machines, or online 
via the Trenitalia app. If you buy your regional train ticket at the station (paper ticket), you must validate it at the 
green stamp machines located on the stairs on the way to the platforms. Make sure to do so as  fines are high!

We bought all our tickets at the machines, which were not intuitive the first time, but by the end of the trip I could 
complete all the steps almost with my eyes closed. Cinque Terre Express has three ticket price categories that depend on 
the date you travel, and you can see the price chart and detailed schedule on the [website](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-timetable). For us it was low season 
so category A (green) - adults €5, children €2,50. If you’re planning to hop on and off the train between the villages 
during your trip, the Cinque Terre Card is a great choice. It gives you unlimited rides on the Cinque Terre Express trains 
running between La Spezia, Cinque Terre, and Levanto. On top of that, the card also covers access to the paid hiking trails 
between Monterosso and Corniglia. We did not use this option because we also wanted to see the coastline from the ferry.

**Accommodation**

We stayed in two apartments:   
La Spezia - Booked via Airbnb (rating 4.99).
Self check-in, very comfortable, and well-equipped. Located close to the train station but on the opposite side of the 
city centre. The walk to the harbour was about 2 km, but it led through the main shopping street, making it pleasant. A 
large supermarket nearby and a quiet street, highly recommended.    
Marina di Massa - Booked via Booking.com, right next to the beach.
Furniture was more basic, but we had a great outdoor area and a rooftop swimming pool. The kitchen was very minimally 
equipped, fine for breakfast and snacks, but not for cooking. The place was run by a lovely family who were always ready 
to help. There were quite a lot of toys in the garden but mostly for kids up to age of 3 (our daughter used often swing).
Average cost: €110 per night

**Food & Eating Out**

Since we love Italian food, we didn’t visit any other type of restaurant. We usually ordered primi (pasta, risotto, 
gnocchi), which we prefer the most. Secondo (meat, fish, seafood) was less appealing to us, and ordering both would 
usually be too much food, especially since we always left room for ice cream. A coperto fee (€1.50–€2.50 per person) was 
always added. We chose budget restaurants with very good reviews

**Our Experience of Travelling with a Child**

Traveling by public transport (train, bus, ferry) was easy with our daughter as she likes to move around and doesn’t enjoy 
sitting in a car seat. We had pram with us that we used a lot in Pisa, Massa and 
La Spezia. We used a pram a lot in Pisa, Massa, and La Spezia. In Cinque Terre it was less practical, but necessary due to the 
long walk to the harbour (around 2.2km). Prams are allowed on ferries, but in some villages we had to fold and carry it. 
Riomaggiore was so steep that we left the pram at a kayak rental place. We travelled with an old pram and weren’t too 
worried about theft. 
We did not find many playgrounds; one was on the beach next to our apartment in Marina di Massa, which was really nice. 
However, this was not a big problem because visiting churches, botanical gardens, and parks was good entertainment for 
our toddler. As for public toilets, we did not actively look for them, as it was enough to use those in restaurants when 
we had a meal, in the botanical garden in Pisa, on the ferry, or on the train. The train was actually the most problematic 
because there were usually only two toilets in the whole train, and one was often out of order. We sometimes had to walk 
a very long distance through the train to reach one that was working, and when the train was crowded, this was very 
challenging.

**Final Thoughts and Recommendations**

This was a very relaxing trip with perfect October weather, excellent food, and a great mix of popular and less touristy 
destinations. Cinque Terre was stunning, Pisa surprisingly enjoyable, and Massa a calm coastal base. Travelling by train 
along the Italian coast worked perfectly for us, and we would absolutely do it again.
