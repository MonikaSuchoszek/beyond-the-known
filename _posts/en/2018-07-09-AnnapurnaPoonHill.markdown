We arrived in Kathmandu on the first of March and found ourselves jet-lagged and in the middle of the Holi festival, 
Nepal's most colorful holiday! It happened by accident so we were totally shocked at the beginning and not ready 
for what was coming :) Before we even reached our hotel, a thick layer of colorful powder covered our faces and 
shoulders :p This day we also walked to the Nepal Tourism Board to get our permits 
([more info]({% post_url 2018-07-11-Annapurna-Practical %})), passing many parties, full of colorful, dancing people. In the 
whole city you can feel the atmosphere of festival, shops are closed, people are blessing each other with colorful 
powder, shouting: Happy Holi! Nowadays kids throw small balloons filled with water on passers what I experienced 
on my own skin few times :p Luckily, we got our permits on the spot and immediately bought bus tickets to Pokhara 
and headed there next day morning.

The first bus ride to Pokhara immediately showed us the reality of bus transportation in Nepal. Don't count on 
internet, don't look for a bus which was demonstrated you on the photo in the ticket office. Best to show your 
ticket to random bus drivers and finally someone will point you to an old, decrepit, local bus where you will 
have to sit for the next 7h ... at least this time we could sit ;) The road from Kathmandu to Pokhara is in pretty 
bad condition, partially asphalt is missing what means it is shaky and dusty. So better take a pill if you suffer 
from car sickness. Fortunately, we had breaks for breakfast and lunch so we survived this ride in a 
pretty good shape. After one night in Pokhara, small, last-minute shopping and the next day, early morning, we 
headed to Besishahar where our hike started. We didn't get out off the city without problems, our bus was 
overcrowded (something like double amount of people for the number of seats) and we had to stand the whole 
4.5h drive, squeezed in a filthy bus where Sebastian couldn't even stand straight because of his height 
(1.88 m / 6'2") :O After we finally arrived to Besishahar it was definitely time to start the hike in a nice, 
clean environment and far away from the buses. The first part to Bhulbhule was not tough, the path lead through 
a few villages and past our first suspension bridge. While the terrain is rather flat it was pretty warm what made 
us feeling exhausted at the end of a day nonetheless. We quickly found a wooden guesthouse with view on the river, 
however the next day we discovered that actually the village is stretched a couple hundreds meters further with 
nicer looking options to sleep further away.

<p class="caption">Main path crossing Bhulbhule village</p>

We didn't meet many hikers on the way because (as our host told us) most people take a jeep right up to 
Chame (2690m), skipping the first 3-4 days of the trek. They maybe save time but definitely lose the opportunity 
to observe the transition of the landscape and, by ascending that fast, many of the them later struggle with high 
altitude disease (actually Manang is the furthest village which can be reached by jeep).  We were following the red 
and white signs indicating the Annapurna Circuit trail, taking us away from the dusty road and leading across the 
tiny villages (quite often adding extra elevation to go through in comparison to the road). On our second day to 
Jagat, we admired blooming trees, rice paddies and banana trees along the way.

The first drops of rain begin to fall as we reached the village Jagat and during the whole night heavy rain was 
hitting the metal roof making it very hard to sleep without earplugs :p To our astonishment, the next morning was 
beautiful, no clouds or any marks after night's rainstorm. This day was tough, first a steep descent, then long 
ascent on a very rocky and steep path and again descent to one of the prettiest villages on the trek, Tal. Full 
of colorful guesthouses, localized next to the sandy riverbanks, made us feel we want to stay there overnight, but 
we stuck to our plan and went further to Dharapani.

Our efforts were rewarded with a very nice room, delicious food (Heaven hotel, next to the suspension bridge). This 
was also last day with internet access and the last warm night during this hike. After another rainy night, a 
beautiful morning motivated us to leave early. This day was very pleasant, for the first time we could see 
majestic, snow-capped peaks, among them Manaslu (eighth highest mountain in the world).

We were slowly gaining altitude the whole day with only few very steep parts in the woods. Passing tiny villages 
and quiet coniferous forest was so relaxing! :D After we found a hotel in Chame we took a walk around the 
village and noticed piles of empty plastic bottles lying in the stream. We also noticed in the evening that our 
host is burning plastic trash in the oven of our dining area, emitting highly toxic chemicals and it was not the 
only place we saw this happening. It would be great if all hikers took responsibility for this issue and carry 
their own plastic garbage back to Pokhara as we did. Tourists should be aware of this problem since we can all 
play a role in reducing plastic pollution.

The next day, on the way to Upper Pisang we noticed a higher number of hikers as this is the starting point for 
most tourists doing the Annapurna Circuit. Cloudless, blue sky above us and a crystal clear stream below made this 
part really pleasant. The rocky slopes were carved out to make room for the road, creating interesting overhangs 
to walk under. At one point you can choose between a road leading to Lower Pisang and path leading to Upper 
Pisang, the second one was our choice. During this part we could finally admiring the stunning Annapurna massif 
with peak Annapurna I, the first of the eight-thousanders to be climbed (French team, 1950). Polish climbers, 
Jerzy Kukuczka and Artur Hajzer made the first winter ascent of Annapurna I in 1987. We decided to stay in a 
wooden house with the view of Lower Pisang and Annapurna. The whole place looked quite new, however one layer of 
wooden panels without any insulation made our night rather cold.

There are two ways to reach Manang from Upper Pisang, the lower route along the road and the upper one which is 
way more demanding but you will be rewarded with scenic views from Ghyaru village (3730m). For the first time I 
fell far behind Sebastian, while carrying a heavy backpack up steep paths he has an advantage. Indeed, the 
panoramic view was breathtaking, many people decided to have a break at the viewpoint and so did we.

After the Ghyaru village it wasn't that difficult anymore, at one point the path started to descent, it got 
more dusty and softer on the path. Very close to the destination for that day, we passed another village, 
Bhraka where path to Ice Lake begins and some people decided to stay here. We went further towards the bigger 
village, Manang were decided to stay 3 nights. We made a good choice about the accommodation (Royal Manang Hotel): 
caring host, tasty food and warm dining room was exactly what we needed. To acclimatize better and avoid high 
altitude disease, we made day trip to Ice Lake (4600m), however only reached the Tea House on 4200m. It was a 
mistake to not take a hiking poles, small rocks on that steep hill were pretty annoying. It is definitely 
worth to try this path since the views are just amazing! At one point, two wolves flashed behind the trees, we 
were thrilled but also a bit scared :)

The next day was a resting day to gather energy for the final part. Sitting outside in the sun with our books 
and short walk to the nearby lake were our only activities that day. In Manang there is a check point with the 
weather forecast, however not very useful since the predictions cover a very big part of the region and are 
updated once a week :p Additionally, officers didn't know what the conditions on the Thorong La Pass were, 
they don't have contact with the High Camp at all. It seems a simple radio to communicate could easily increase 
safety in case the weather get worse. It was around -12°C at night and -2°C during the day during our stay. There 
are also few shops with hiking equipment and few bakeries with delicious, fresh rolls.

Next morning, we headed off to Churi Ledar and stayed there one, very cold night :p This part of a trek was not 
very difficult and not very long so we took it slowly. We were passed by many donkeys/mules/horses, carrying food 
to the higher shelters.

Since we did not have any symptoms of high altitude disease our decision was to go to the High Camp next day and 
see how we feel (ascent 600m). We simply did not want to spend an additional night in these low temperatures :p 
First, the path was going constantly up and down, so we needed about 2.5h to gain 300m altitude. Then we stopped 
for lunch in Thorong Phedi village (the Low Camp) where most people spend an additional night.

<img src="/assets/Nepal/Annapurna/DSC01713.jpg">
<p class="caption">Thorong Phedi village surrounded by high rocky slopes</p>

We realized that ahead of us is a 300m ascent on a very short section what means really steep slope. And indeed, 
the zigzag path wore me down arriving at the shelter feeling drained. Sebastian on the other hand was having a 
great day (how frustrating it was!). That day I could really notice that we did not have a porter but I feel 
better carrying my own stuff, the achievement feels more complete. High Camp consists of few buildings which 
belongs to one owner and a big dining room where we spend the whole evening, trying to warm up next to the stove.

<img src="/assets/Nepal/Annapurna/DSC01717.jpg">

We ordered breakfast as early as possible (6am) and decided to start the most important part of the hike straight 
after. There were many icy spots around the camp in the morning and the remaining snow was hard, making the path 
very slippery and dangerous. We had to be really careful while traversing the slopes and using our hiking poles 
for balancing. The path ahead of us did not look very steep but it was demanding because of the altitude and our 
backpacks. Finally, the small shed appeared on the horizon and we knew that was tiny tea shop at Thorong La Pass. 
We made it, 5416m this is the highest pass we have ever been on! :D Somehow, it did not feel like a great 
achievement, too many people around us ... what always takes away some of the beauty of being alone in the 
mountains. Going through the pass is not as exciting as reaching a peak ... so I need a tougher goal next time :D

The way down was stretching forever, first dangerous patches of ice, then loose rocks kept us constantly tense, 
trying not to fall. The landscape changed dramatically, red and brown as a dominent colors, very dusty and no 
vegetation around.

In Muktinath, we stayed in the guesthouse close to the bus stop where we could finally took a warm shower 
and use the internet to catch up with our families. Next morning, after waiting more than 1 hour for a bus, 
we finally got on one going to Old Jamson, from where we walked the last 6km to our destination, Marpha village.

<p class="caption">Stalls with the local products in Muktinath</p>

The path was covered with deep layer of dust and every time some jeep passed the huge cloud of dust covered us 
what made this walk really unpleasant. In contrary, Marpha village was really relaxing, very narrow paths inside 
and sanctuary on the hill. The young monks opened the main praying hall for us which was covered with colorful 
pieces of fabrics. We admired the view of the village and noticed many people using their flat roofs as a terraces.

This region is famous for locally produced apple and apricot juice but also offers other products like cider, 
jam and cakes. It was a great place for a rest.

<p class="caption">Apricot juice was just superb! :)</p>

Instead of walking down the valley the next few days we decided to take a bus to Tatopani (5h) and start the 
very popular Poon Hill trek from there. Tatopani is surrounded by orange trees and many flowers which make it looks 
really pretty! There are also hot springs nearby what makes this place a perfect spot to chill out, however we 
only had a lunch there and started our walk to Shikha. After passing the village and crossing the river, the 
main path began, endless steps made with huge rocks  were ahead of us, constantly crossing  a dusty road for 
jeeps. It was already late afternoon and the first drops of rain reached us. An approaching storm? We decided to 
play it safe and stop in Braha (a village 2km before Shikha) where the options for accommodation are really 
limited so we don't advise you to stop there.

The next day we walked all the way up to Ghorepani where we found huge variety of accommodation, from big 
hotels to the tiny guesthouses. We stayed at Annapurna Lodge View, which provides very clean rooms and delicious 
food! The whole valley around Poon Hill was covered with blooming rhododendrons, dark pink colored flowers made the 
whole surroundings looks gorgeous.

The trekking here is really different from what we experienced on Annapurna Circuit. Walking on steps made with 
rocks got quite boring after a while but the rice paddies and dense, green forest compensate for it. Our last 
trekking day was very intense, first we were admiring sunrise on Poon Hill (we left at 5am from our lodge), then 
had breakfast in our guesthouse and finally headed off to Ghandruk. Every morning 200-300 people are gathering 
on Poon Hill to admire the first rays of sunlight hitting the mountain peaks. It got really cold up there what 
took away a bit of a joy from this early hike.

<img src="/assets/Nepal/Annapurna/DSC01833.jpg">

The sign in Ghorepani says it should be 7h to Ghandruk (usually people split this part into 2 days). We were 
very surprised that the first hour was leading uphill, passing Deurali Pass Viewpoint from where we could admire 
the Poon Hill from a distance. Finally, the path started to descend with very high, rocky steps. To our surprise, 
the last 30min before Tadapani the path was leading up again ... this really destroyed me so it was perfect time to 
stop for a lunch. After that, full of energy, we walked the last part to Ghandruk. The path was leading through 
bushy forest and green fields.

We were very glad to end up in Sakura Hotel. The owner also had a small bakery, very clean rooms and, to our surprise,
we were there the only guests! Next few days we spent in [Pokhara]({% post_url 2018-07-11-Annapurna-Practical %}) before leaving to Kathmandu from where we had our 
plane to Bangkok.

of hiking we managed to complete around 197km :D This was the longest trekking we have ever done in our lives. It 
was amazing experience and if you only have a chance, go there and experience local culture and beauty of nature.
