"We'll never do this again!" that was a decision we made after approximately 32 km (however a year ago, during our 
first attempt, I was swearing the same :p). This year we were fast enough to avoid elimination and finished the 
Iron Viking (Water Edition) in 6 h 54 min. The goal was to run full marathon with +100 obstacles within 7.5 hours. 
The obstacles were very diverse, some of them required strength for lifting and hauling heavy weights (which 
were easier for Sebastian). I definitely preferred those with rings, metal tubes, ropes to go through which were 
for me, a climber, easier but still big challenge and a lot of fun!

considerably more difficult :p</p>

condition :p</p>
