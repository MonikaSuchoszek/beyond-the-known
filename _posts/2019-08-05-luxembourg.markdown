Visiting Berdorf area in Luxemburg? Why not! We couldn't miss our chance to finally check one of the options for a weekend trip when you live in Belgium. The initial idea was to do the whole Mullerthal trail route 2 which is around 37km, however live as usually modified our plan a little bit. Since we left Leuven on Saturday morning and arrived to Berdorf (starting point of a trek) at 10.30 am there was not enough time to do our plan so on the way we decided to skip one loop and took a shortcut to the next village. The first part (around 6km) from Berdorf to Mullerthal led along a big rocky walls, the further we got from the car parking, the quieter it got with less and less hikiers on the way. The large, high rocks situated close to each other started to create a narrow passages, darker and colder inside.

The Mullerthal village offers a camping site, some places to buy drinks and fast food. We passed the village quite fast, constantly following a wooden poles with the name of a trek. After some time we have seen Schiessent√ºmpel Cascade, famous waterfall atracting many tourists but I need to admit, they are rather small ;) The shape and style of the wooden bridge above made a bigger impression on me.

A bit further, close to the viewpoint Burgkapp we had a chance to shorten our hike and go straight ahead to the village Consdorf, skipping few km loop more to the south. We passed Burgkapp, La Pineda camping site, Consdorf (there is a bakery close to the church) to finally reach Scheidgen where we started to follow again Mullerthal trail route 2. The part from here to Echternach was a bit borring. Beautiful, old forest but less groups of rocks which you can explore inside.

The view of village Echternach where we had a dinner and an ice cream :) Visiting this touristic place required us walking steep part downhill and come back the same way what means stip uphil part as well but it was worth it. On the photo below you can clearly see St. Willibrord Basilica, dominates the landscape.

Next day we explored the area nearby our camping in Berdorf. Amazing viewpoints where you can admire hills sourrounding the area are a great spot for many tourists to relax. Numerous narrow passages between the rocks attract children with head lights, exploring them without any fear. We really got lost amongst narror corridors, feel like being in a labyrinth! Good shoes are highly recommended since the rocks and steps can be quite slippery.

The area has a lot to offer not only for hikers, runners or cyclists but also for sport climbers! Around 1km from camping Martbusch you can find this little but very interesting area with sandstone rock. Most of the climbing routes are in the range of 5 and 6. Beautiful forest around makes this spot colder what every climber appreciate during the hot summer :)

__Practical info:__

Mullerthal trail route 2 - 31km, we skipped around 7km part in south, taking a shortcut from Consdorfer Millen parking to Scheidgen where we again started to follow Mullerthal trail 2 until Berdorf, see the map below for details

We stayed at the Camping Belle-Vue 2000 (around 8euro/person, steel fire bowl and portion of wood - 12 euro) in Berdorf. There are many campings in the area of Mullerthal trail route 2 so it is definitely possible to split the whole track into few parts and explore the area a bit more. There are really plenty places to check, beautiful rock formations, view points, caves which are difficult to really explore if you do the whole treck in one day like we did.
