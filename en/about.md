Monika and Sebastian, a Polish-Belgian couple that recently moved to the beautiful city of Leuven 
(Belgium) after living in marvelous Potsdam (Germany) the last 4 years. We both love to travel 
(especially when it includes hiking) and to embrace new experiences and challenges ðŸ™‚

We started traveling together in 2014, an have visited many cities in Belgium 
(Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent) and [Poland]({{ '/tag/en_US/poland' | prepend: site.base }}) (Warsaw, WrocÅ‚aw, PoznaÅ„, Krakow, MiÄ™dzyzdroje, 
Zakopane). Every year we also aim to go for a longer [hiking]({{ '/tag/en_US/hiking' | prepend: site.base }}) trip! So far we visited Morocco, 
Iceland, [Georgia]({{ '/tag/en_US/georgia' | prepend: site.base }}) and most recently the Himalayas. We also discovered the beauty of the Karkonosze 
and Tatras mountain-ranges in Poland along with the Alps in Bergamo, [Italy]({{ '/tag/en_US/italy' | prepend: site.base }}). We challenge ourselves 
to do different running competitions like half-marathons and obstacle runs (including the Iron 
Viking, which claims to be the worlds toughest marathon). On the top of than we did many weekend 
trips in Europe (Cambridge, Barcelona, Leipzig, Hamburg).

This year, we decided to take a break between moving to Belgium and switching jobs to travel a few months and
discover Southeast Asia. Our journey began with a month in [Singapore]({{ '/tag/en_US/singapore' | prepend: site.base }}), where we experienced 
tropical temperatures and stunning, extraordinary architecture. This was for us like a city from 
the future. After a short stay in Europe, we headed to [Nepal]({{ '/tag/en_US/nepal' | prepend: site.base }}) and finished the Annapurna circuit 
in the [Himalayas]({{ '/tag/en_US/himalayas' | prepend: site.base }}). We could not imagine a trip without some exhausting hiking among the highest 
peaks in the world. Then we started a search for mysterious temples in [Cambodia]({{ '/tag/en_US/cambodia' | prepend: site.base }}), 
[Laos]({{ '/tag/en_US/laos' | prepend: site.base }}) and Thailand.
