  <p>My maternity leave was coming to the end</p>

<p>Following main shopping street until we reached The Rua Augusta Arch, a stone, memorial arch-like, historical building 
leading to open waterfront square. One of the biggest squares in Europe, Praca do Comercio with statue of King José I. 
In the neighbourhood there is also very famous Elevador de Santa Justa which feels like an unnecessary invention since
street going to the top of the hill has couple hundred of meters and there are many more places where elevator would be 
much more useful. View point of Santa Justa lift was closed so we went immediately to check Archaeological museum that is
located on the top of this hills with charming square in front of it.</p>

<p>The Carmo Ruins and Archaeological museum is definitely worth to check! It’s now the ruins of old Church  of the Convent 
of Santa Maria do Carmo that was destroyed during the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake leaving it without roof. Reconstruction works
started but were quickly abandon and impressive naves left without cover and the chapels incomplete. Skeletal remains of 
the huge church shows destruction caused by the earthquake. In 5 rooms, you can 
find there exhibitions with pieces from very different periods and cultures like Peruvian mummy or 4th century sarcophagus.
Some walls are decorated with large and beautiful azuelejos tiles. The outside area is beautiful and great for interesting 
pictures. Entry is €5 per adult.</p>

<p>Lisbon has so many hills and steep stairs! However, this means that everyone will have a chance to find their favourite
view point as there are plenty to choose! Jardim da Cerca da Graça with small park around was 5min walking distance from our 
apartment. It was a steep walk uphill but the area nearby was full of restaurants, small bakeries and shops with fresh 
fruits and vegetables.</p>

</div>

<p>Alfama is another interesting neighbourhood full of narrow streets, strething just below castle and few viewpoints: 
Miradouro de Santa Luzia and Miradouro das Portas do Sol. Get lost in the maze of narrow 
and beautiful streets, try cherry ginja and “salami” (kind of cookie) in one of the old bakeries.There are plenty of 
typical shops, cafes, bars, restaurants. In addition, Alfama is one of the places where fado shows can be 
experienced in Lisbon, we saw offers for the evening shows in front of the small typical restaurants.
This part of the city
first survived the great earthquake in 1755 and subsequent fires. The epicentre was in the middle of Atlantic Ocean and 
the biggest tsunami hit Lisbon shortly afterwards. Almost all buildings in the city were collapsed by tsunami, floated by 
the water or burned in fire. Alfama, was the only district that survived in a good condition with solid stone and high 
enough to avoid tsunami.</p>

<p>Our apartament was less than 15min walking from famous São Jorge Castle. There were many peacocks which live in the 
grounds of the castle, sitting on the trees and walking between the visitors, displaying their impressive tail plumage. 
Shaded gardens surrounding castle’s defensive walls, were great place to hide from strong midday sun. Stunning view of the central 
Lisbon and Tagus river there terrace along the ramparts. 
There was a small exhibition displaying items found within the castle. Very pretty streets around the castle. We were 
there quite early,
around 10am and sizeable queue was already getting long but we used family line which was almost empty, it worked great 
everywhere in Lisbon. If you want to avoid waiting to buy tickets at the ticket office, buy it online in advance!</p>

<p>We left the Jerónimos Monastery and Belém Tower, two of the most visited sites in Lisbon, for the last day of our stay. 
First, you need to go and queue at the ticket office, and then, with your ticket, go straight to the entrance of the monastery. 
It’s not the same entrance, and it was confusing once we arrived there. There is also another line to enter the Church of 
Santa Maria de Belém, but this queue moves quite fast. The entrance to the church is free and it’s worth to stop by. You 
can see a few tombs there, including Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea. 
Afterwards, we finally headed to the monastery, and this time, again, we didn’t have to wait long because of family queue. We were a bit 
disappointed when, after maybe 30-40 minutes, we realized that there was nothing more to see. Besides the famous inner 
courtyard of the monastery, there were not many exhibits explaining history of this place. The main attraction is just 
walking the upstairs and downstairs corridors and admiring the architecture.
Don’t forget to queue again for the famous pastéis from the legendary Pastéis de Belém down the road. We were not sure if 
these were our favorite pastéis. There is a small park close by where you can have a rest on the bench in the shade of the 
trees. We also took a walk to see the Belém Tower, but it was closed for renovation. Lunch in the nearby restaurant, Adega 
de Belém, was the perfect end to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Practical info:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The airport has perfect connection with the city by metro. We bought rechargeable card called Viva Viagem Card
that we used for both of us for metro, tram and train. You pay for this card 0.5euro. Train to Cascais/Sintra/Estoril 
only 1.90euro per person, one way. Metro, one ride 1.35euro. Tram to Belem was around 1.5euro and if you buy ticket from 
the machine in the tram itself, it will be 3euro. Definitely very convenient to buy this card. It’s good to know more or less the 
prices for a single ride and where you want to go because you can’t get back the money left on the card. Whenever you scan 
the card, you can see how much is still on it. This is the way how we figure out how much was each ride and then we just 
charged the card again with more money. You can use this card also for the ferry (prices should be between 1-2euro)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stayed in the city center and this was our biggest mistake because of the noise, until late evening hours. It 
happened few times that someone was discarding glass afer midnight, probably when restaurants were closing. We could hear
every step, every conversation from the apartment above. Our idea was that if we stay in the city center, we could always 
come back to the apartment in the middle of the day so our baby can have a nap in the crip but ultimately she was napping
in our soft-structured carrier (BabyBjorn, model Baby Carrier One)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <img src="/assets/Portugal/Lisbon/20220215_153807.jpg" class="column-50" />
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Very friendly people, in the restaurants and shops. There were special lines for people with kids so we didn’t have 
to wait at the entrance to any tourist attraction.</li>
  <li>It was almost impossible to find a restaurant that would have baby changing station in the toilet, it was actually
very difficult to fit there with the baby at all. In the city center, space is limited so also it the restaurants, tables 
are close to each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Day trips:
Sintra - Park of Pena - Moorish Castle - Villa Sassetti, Sintra from train station Rossio
Carcavelos - walk on the beach - Santo Amaro train station
Cascais - Boca do Inferno - Condes de Castro Guimarães Museum</p>
