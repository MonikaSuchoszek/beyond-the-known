        <title>Travelling Italy’s Coast by Train: Pisa, Cinque Terre and Massa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This trip was one of my favourite ways of travelling: flying into a country and then continuing the journey by train straight 
from the airport. It is an incredibly convenient way to travel with kids, especially when train connections are good and 
distances are reasonable. Travelling along the coast by train allows you to stop in multiple cities without the need to 
rent a car, which significantly reduces transportation costs. It’s also ideal if you’re travelling with children who don’t 
enjoy long car rides or if you simply want to relax and not spend your holiday focused on driving. We’ve used this approach 
before in &lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2022/10/Benalmadena-Spain/&quot;&gt;Málaga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2024/11/Valencia/&quot;&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;, and once again it worked perfectly. The only real downside is that you need to choose your 
destination carefully: train connections must be reliable, distances manageable, and attractions accessible without a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Around – Transportation Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flew from Brussels to Pisa Airport, which turned out to be surprisingly small and easy to navigate. After landing, we 
took a train called PisaMover to Pisa Centrale. This option was advertised as the fastest but it was also the most expensive. 
PisaMover is a high-speed shuttle running frequently between the airport and Pisa Centrale from 6:00 AM to midnight. Duration 
of the ride is only 5 minutes. Price: €6.50 adults / €4.50 children (each way).
Children under a certain age were said to travel free, but information was inconsistent. We paid €26 in total for the ride 
from the airport. At the ticket office, we were told our 4-year-old didn’t need a ticket, which contradicts the official 
website stating that all children require one. Considering the distance is under 2 km and easily walkable, PisaMover felt 
very expensive.
On our return day, we decided to check whether it was possible to walk to the airport instead. The distance was less than 
1.6 km from the city centre, and since we didn’t have much luggage, we gave it a try. It turned out to be a great decision: 
the walk was safe, easy, and took less than 30 minutes. Along the way, we even passed several cafés where we picked up 
pastries before reaching the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the main train station in Pisa, we continued our journey to La Spezia where we stayed first 2 nights. We used regional
trains from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html&quot;&gt;Trenitalia&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, we moved to Marina di Massa for the rest of our stay. From there, we did a day 
trip to Pisa by train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train Tickets (Total Costs)
Pisa → La Spezia – €37.80 (€8.40 per adult / €4.20 per child)&lt;br /&gt;
La Spezia → Massa Centro – €22.50 (€5.00 per adult / €2.50 per child)&lt;br /&gt;
Massa Centro → Pisa – €27.90 (€6.40 per adult / €3.20 per child)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Buses in Massa &lt;br /&gt;
Total spent: €25.70 &lt;br /&gt;
•	Ticket price: €1.70 per ride &lt;br /&gt;
•	Valid for 70 minutes after activation &lt;br /&gt;
•	App-based ticketing available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We installed the local bus app, created an account, and bought tickets directly using a credit card. You must remember to 
activate the ticket before boarding, which can be slightly confusing as the app is not fully translated into English. The 
first time, I asked another passenger for confirmation. After that, it was very easy to use. You can activate multiple 
tickets at once, which is very convenient when travelling as a group. Children under 1 metre in height travel for free. 
Our daughter (104 cm) did not have a ticket, and during a ticket inspection we were told it was fine. In practice, this 
rule seems difficult to enforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting Cinque Terre by combining ferry and train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of buying a full-day ferry ticket, we chose a one-way ferry ticket with intermediate stops and returned by train. 
This allowed us to spend more time in Monterosso and avoid a very long ferry ride back (up to 2 hours). The ferry was calm 
and quiet at first, but already in Riomaggiore it became extremely crowded. At one point, the ferry was so full that we 
had to split into two groups because there were no seats left. On board, only cold drinks and snacks were available, but 
the toilets were very useful when travelling with a child. The weather was beautiful and sunny, though quite windy, but 
still very pleasant for October. We were shocked by the crowds at Riomaggiore train station. The ferry felt busy, but 
the number of people on the platform was intense. We returned by train after 5 PM from Monterosso. The train was already crowded from Vernazza, so boarding in Monterosso 
was actually an advantage: we could easily find seats and enter with a pram. One downside of Italian trains is the toilets. 
There are usually only one or two per train, and often one is out of order. When the train is packed, reaching a working 
toilet with a child is very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Pisa/20251016_113419_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Ferry and Train Schedule&lt;/strong&gt; that allowed us to have enough time to explore each of the stops &lt;br /&gt;
Ferry: La Spezia 09:15 → Porto Venere 10:00 (1h break) &lt;br /&gt;
Ferry: Porto Venere 11:00 → Riomaggiore 11:35 (1h break) &lt;br /&gt;
Ferry: Riomaggiore 12:35 → Vernazza 13:10 (2h break) &lt;br /&gt;
Ferry: Vernazza 15:10 → Monterosso 15:30 &lt;br /&gt;
Train: Monterosso → La Spezia (25 min). We could have also stopped in Manarola and taken the next train from there to 
La Spezia, but we were simply too tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-day roundtrip ticket Cinque Terre (€42 per adult / €15 per child) &lt;br /&gt;
One-way ticket with intermediate stops (€30 per adult / €15 per child)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited Cinque Terre at the very end of the ferry season. Ferries run from late March until November 1, with reduced frequency 
until early December. More information about the prices and current schedule &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/boat-excursions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Pisa/20251016_140355_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinque Terre Express&lt;/strong&gt; trains connect Levanto, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, Riomaggiore, and La Spezia. They 
run frequently from early morning until late evening. Tickets can be bought at stations, from ticket machines, or online 
via the Trenitalia app. If you buy your regional train ticket at the station (paper ticket), you must validate it at the 
green stamp machines located on the stairs on the way to the platforms. Make sure to do so as  fines are high!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought all our tickets at the machines, which were not intuitive the first time, but by the end of the trip I could 
complete all the steps almost with my eyes closed. Cinque Terre Express has three ticket price categories that depend on 
the date you travel, and you can see the price chart and detailed schedule on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-timetable&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. For us it was low season 
so category A (green) - adults €5, children €2,50. If you’re planning to hop on and off the train between the villages 
during your trip, the Cinque Terre Card is a great choice. It gives you unlimited rides on the Cinque Terre Express trains 
running between La Spezia, Cinque Terre, and Levanto. On top of that, the card also covers access to the paid hiking trails 
between Monterosso and Corniglia. We did not use this option because we also wanted to see the coastline from the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in two apartments: &lt;br /&gt;
La Spezia - Booked via Airbnb (rating 4.99).
Self check-in, very comfortable, and well-equipped. Located close to the train station but on the opposite side of the 
city centre. The walk to the harbour was about 2 km, but it led through the main shopping street, making it pleasant. A 
large supermarket nearby and a quiet street, highly recommended.  &lt;br /&gt;
Marina di Massa - Booked via Booking.com, right next to the beach.
Furniture was more basic, but we had a great outdoor area and a rooftop swimming pool. The kitchen was very minimally 
equipped, fine for breakfast and snacks, but not for cooking. The place was run by a lovely family who were always ready 
to help. There were quite a lot of toys in the garden but mostly for kids up to age of 3 (our daughter used often swing).
Average cost: €110 per night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Pisa/20251017_154813_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food &amp;amp; Eating Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we love Italian food, we didn’t visit any other type of restaurant. We usually ordered primi (pasta, risotto, 
gnocchi), which we prefer the most. Secondo (meat, fish, seafood) was less appealing to us, and ordering both would 
usually be too much food, especially since we always left room for ice cream. A coperto fee (€1.50–€2.50 per person) was 
always added. We chose budget restaurants with very good reviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemplary prices: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/lsaR5la5YGNmDT9Mg&quot;&gt;Pizza Verace in La Spezia&lt;/a&gt;: €8–14 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/pwJqo6vdELpDe7KDq&quot;&gt;Bottega Visconti 1973 in Vernazza&lt;/a&gt;: focaccia €8–12, savoury rice pie €5 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/f2cCj81djdPUgIwYp&quot;&gt;Locanda del Tron in Massa&lt;/a&gt;: €13 fixed menu (primo, secondo, coffee, water).  Family business with great reviews. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/pGPcZyHeO4DN8JEir&quot;&gt;La Ghiotteria in Pisa&lt;/a&gt;: primi €9–13 (very large portions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best ice cream places: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/wAqh538eqZ22D1CW6&quot;&gt;Gelateria Troppo Buono in Marina di Massa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Experience of Travelling with a Child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling by public transport (train, bus, ferry) was easy with our daughter as she likes to move around and doesn’t enjoy 
sitting in a car seat. We had pram with us that we used a lot in Pisa, Massa and 
La Spezia. We used a pram a lot in Pisa, Massa, and La Spezia. In Cinque Terre it was less practical, but necessary due to the 
long walk to the harbour (around 2.2km). Prams are allowed on ferries, but in some villages we had to fold and carry it. 
Riomaggiore was so steep that we left the pram at a kayak rental place. We travelled with an old pram and weren’t too 
worried about theft. 
We did not find many playgrounds; one was on the beach next to our apartment in Marina di Massa, which was really nice. 
However, this was not a big problem because visiting churches, botanical gardens, and parks was good entertainment for 
our toddler. As for public toilets, we did not actively look for them, as it was enough to use those in restaurants when 
we had a meal, in the botanical garden in Pisa, on the ferry, or on the train. The train was actually the most problematic 
because there were usually only two toilets in the whole train, and one was often out of order. We sometimes had to walk 
a very long distance through the train to reach one that was working, and when the train was crowded, this was very 
challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/ozuxGCapAk1bWRV17&quot;&gt;Payground in Monterosso&lt;/a&gt; - nice place to stop while visiting Cinque Terre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts and Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very relaxing trip with perfect October weather, excellent food, and a great mix of popular and less touristy 
destinations. Cinque Terre was stunning, Pisa surprisingly enjoyable, and Massa a calm coastal base. Travelling by train 
along the Italian coast worked perfectly for us, and we would absolutely do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Family Road Trip in Denmark – 10 Days of Cool Adventures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We always travel during the summer months when school is closed, but after last year’s heat in Spain, we were determined 
to find a cooler destination. Denmark turned out to be the perfect choice, mild weather, beautiful scenery, and a relaxed 
pace of life. We spent 10 full days in Denmark in the second half of August, a wonderful way to recharge before the start 
of the new school year. The weather was exactly as we hoped: 18–24°C, a bit windy at times, and only a few brief moments 
of rain. Perfect conditions for a family road trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Route and General Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning the trip, I ambitiously marked spots across the entire country, but quickly realized it would be impossible 
to see everything. In the end, we created a 1,500 km loop, visiting four out of Denmark’s five regions:
Sjælland (Zealand), Syddanmark (Southern Denmark), Midtjylland (Central Jutland), Hovedstaden (Capital Region).
The only one we skipped was Nordjylland (North Jutland). A clever way to shorten driving distances was by taking the ferry between
Jylland and Sjælland. It saved us time, added variety to the trip, and let us return to Copenhagen from the west side of 
the country without repeating the same route. See details of our route on the Google Map below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1uhRyL-m2vsOMMu-yupzHgsqT_QSu0IM&amp;amp;ehbc=2E312F&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling with a four-year-old required flexibility and frequent changes of plan, but Denmark turned out to be one of the 
most family-friendly countries we’ve ever visited. There were countless public toilets and amazing playgrounds, often located 
in scenic places and surrounded by nature, a true blessing for anyone travelling with small children!
Architecturally, I expected to see tiny, colorful wooden houses like in Iceland, but most homes resembled those in Germany,
simple, neat, and modern. We did find some charming historical spots though, such as Sønderho and Ribe, where old wooden 
houses create postcard-perfect scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Around – Transportation Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rented a car from &lt;strong&gt;Sixt&lt;/strong&gt;, picking it up and dropping it off at Copenhagen Airport. The process went smoothly overall, 
though we had two small issues:
The prepaid Storebælt Bridge pass didn’t work, and we had to pay again at the gate with a credit card. Sixt later refunded the fee but I had
to send them multiple emails. They also never explained why this situation happened. They should not offer bridge tickets
if this service doesn’t work properly.
During drop-off, all designated Sixt spots were full, and we had to wait for an employee to move a car before we could park which 
made us nervous about being at the airport on time. Note that we were dropping off the car just before office opened and 
probably this issue doesn’t happen if you drop off the car after 6am when the office is open and employees are there.
Despite these moments, the rental experience was positive. Our Opel Corsa was clean, easy to drive, and perfect for Danish roads.
To reach the rental office, take the free shuttle bus from the airport (in front of the Clarion Hotel, every 20 minutes), 
the ride takes about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving in Denmark was a pleasure with calm drivers, beautiful roads, and good infrastructure.
Headlights must be on at all times, even during the day. The only difference I noticed was the rule on how to merge when 
entering the highway. I was surprised not to see the dotted line marking the end of the merge point which was often much shorter than in Belgium. 
Apparently both drivers on the ramp and those on the main road should adjust their speed to allow smooth merging, and that was actually 
happening. Cars were changing lanes immediately or slowing down, so we could always enter the highway without needing to 
stop.
Typical speed limits are:
50 km/h in towns, 80 km/h outside towns, 110–130 km/h on highways&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolls and Ferries&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://storebaelt.dk/en/prices-and-discounts/private/&quot;&gt;Storebælt Bridge&lt;/a&gt;: 230 DKK (31€)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fanoelinjen.dk/&quot;&gt;Fanø Island ferry&lt;/a&gt;: 299 DKK (40€)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.molslinjen.com/&quot;&gt;Aarhus–Sjælland ferry&lt;/a&gt;: 560 DKK (75€, book early, prices rise quickly!). Area marked with green
outline on the photo below is indicating where you can take a seat without having a reservation, everything in the front of 
the ferry is either business blueclass, restaurants or shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250822_103750_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking&lt;/strong&gt;: mostly free outside cities, but expect fees near major attractions. On the below photo (left) you can see sign that
allows to park for free for 2 hours, but you can not park for longer in that zone, even if you would like to pay for additional time.
Tip: check recent Google Maps reviews for parking, prices can vary a lot. &lt;strong&gt;Fuel prices&lt;/strong&gt; ranged between 13.39–13.89 DKK/litre (1.8€/l), 
with Ribe being the cheapest area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Møns Klint: 45 DKK/day (6€)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stevns Klint: 50 DKK/day (6,7€) Very limited free parking in the nearby village. We were there at the end of the day when 
it was empty so we parked on one of the side streets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aarhus: 24 DKK/hour (3,2€); other towns ~7 DKK/hour (0.9€)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250815_174452.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting Copenhagen by Train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locals advised us not to drive into Copenhagen due to parking costs (16–44 DKK/hour, 2-6€/hour), check &lt;a href=&quot;https://international.kk.dk/live/transport-and-parking/parking-in-copenhagen/public-parking-in-copenhagen&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for more details. Instead, we parked for free at Køge 
station and took the train. Tickets can be expensive (regular ticket around 60-70 DKK one way, 9€), but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dsb.dk/en/tickets-and-services/orange/&quot;&gt;DSB Orange Tickets&lt;/a&gt; are a 
great discounted option (20–28 DKK per person, 3-4€), but available only at selected time slots. The train 
ride takes around 40min, but you can get off the train at multiple station in the heart of the city without spending time 
on looking for parking spot. We bought our tickets a week ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Airbnb apartments across the country, almost always entire flats, usually outside cities where prices were 
lower, and it was easier to park with the car. Copenhagen was expensive, so we chose to stay twice in the Køge area, a 
perfect base for day trips to the capital. Most apartments had self check-in via lockbox, and in several places, the hosts 
greeted us personally and shared useful local tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average cost: €110 per night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Booking minimum 4–6 months ahead is ideal for good deals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average rating: 4.9+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food &amp;amp; Eating Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dining out in Denmark is expensive, expect to pay €30–40 per person for a meal with a drink in cheap restaurants. Even simple 
street food like fish and chips costs 100–140 DKK (13-19€). That’s why we mostly cooked in our apartments, which all had excellent 
kitchens, including oven. Supermarkets like Lidl and Rema 1000 were our favourites for value and choice. We had to buy groceries 
in small amounts since we changed locations frequently and didn’t want food sitting in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemplary prices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ice cream: from 50 DKK per scoop (6,7€)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bakery sweets: 40–50 DKK (5,4€-6,7€)
Local restaurant highlight: fresh fish or hearty Danish burger with chips and homemade gravy, delicious!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Experience of Travelling with a Child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel like this is, so far, the most kid-friendly country we have visited. The playgrounds were incredible, we had so 
much fun as a family. Very often, the playgrounds are located in forests, surrounded by beautiful nature, and they also 
feature many wooden sculptures of animals. All the playgrounds were well maintained and mostly made of wood, so they blended 
naturally into the surroundings rather than disrupting them. The Skovlegeplads playground on Fanø Island even had tiny 
wooden cars that you could use to help your kids cover the last couple of hundred meters leading deeper into the forest 
to the playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250821_123212_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250819_114556_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250818_142029_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250818_142857_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited several family-oriented attractions, including 
a &lt;strong&gt;Viking museum&lt;/strong&gt; with period-accurate blacksmithing demonstrations (worth to check which museum has some special event during your stay since there 
are so many viking museums to choose), and the beautiful &lt;strong&gt;Frederiksborg Castle&lt;/strong&gt;, where kids can join a 
treasure-hunt-style activity. It was a perfect balance between culture and playtime. There were also sea-related museums, 
science museums, and a Sand Sculpture Festival, but that was just too much for our stay since we already had a very full schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other family highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free public toilets almost everywhere (at the entrances to beaches, next to parking, toilet automates in the cities)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nice playgrounds even at gas stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five out of six apartments had toys waiting for our daughter, such a thoughtful touch that saved our evenings and mornings.
Since our daughter was sleeping in the car while driving during the day, which helped us tremendously, we had to pay a price 
for this, she was going to sleep late in the evenings. It really does not happen often that there are some toys in the apartments 
when we travel in other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your kids like fairy-tale adventures, try finding &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Dambo’s wooden trolls&lt;/strong&gt; (there are about 60–70 across Denmark, 
see &lt;a href=&quot;https://trollmap.com/#/ene&quot;&gt;Troll Map&lt;/a&gt; for more details. Our daughter got scared by the first one (Troll nr81, left
photo below), but it’s a fun activity for older kids! The second troll below is the one in famous Christianshavn neighbourhood,
called Green George.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250816-WA0048_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Denmark/Summary/20250824_135852_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical notes and some surprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was not easy to figure out what exactly the products in the supermarkets were, we had to translate the labels with 
our phones since the language was too different from the ones we know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our Revolut virtual card worked almost everywhere except in Spar and Netto (we used a credit card there).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Pant” deposit applies to bottles and cans, and refunds must be used in the same shop (you can’t use it in another shop 
from the same chain).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During the whole stay, I saw a Danish coin only once, when my husband found one in the park. It was a very strange feeling 
to travel for 10 days without using cash even once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts and Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d definitely visit Denmark again but next time, perhaps add cycling (especially on islands like Fanø, which is perfect 
for biking at only 14 km long). This country is perfect for families, older travellers, and anyone seeking peace rather 
than nightlife. It’s less crowded than Spain or Italy even in summer, still full of charm. We would recommend to bring 
binoculars for spotting seals and other wild animals. Our unforgettable moments were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flowering heaths on &lt;strong&gt;Fanø Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing wild deer in &lt;strong&gt;Dyrehaven Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cute wooden houses in &lt;strong&gt;Sønderho&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ribe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scenic drives along the coast with fishing town &lt;strong&gt;Gilleleje&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stunning &lt;strong&gt;chalk cliffs of Møns Klint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these will get its own detailed post soon so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Przygoda na Maderze: Dzień 5 -  Pico Ruivo, Santana oraz opuszczona plaża</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nasz pobyt na Maderze zbliżał się ku końcowi, przed nami ostatni dzień z wynajętym samochodem! Intensywne dni szybko mijały, 
a i plan na ostatni dzień był bardzo napięty. Zdecydowaliśmy się zacząć dzień od pieszej wędrówki na &lt;strong&gt;Pico Ruivo&lt;/strong&gt;, najwyższy 
szczyt Madery. Podczas naszego pobytu w listopadzie 2024 roku oficjalna strona turystyki informowała, że otwarty jest jedynie 
odcinek do schroniska. Było to jednak dla mnie nie do końca jasne, ponieważ na Google Maps pojawiało się wiele nowych recenzji 
ze zdjęciami z samego szczytu. Założyliśmy więc, że dotarcie na wierzchołek będzie możliwe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Szlak był przepiękny i relaksujący, ale niestety sam szczyt (ostatnie 400 metrów) był zamknięty z powodu uszkodzeń po pożarach. 
Ogień osłabił strukturę gleby, przez co teren stał się bardziej niebezpieczny. Zainstalowano prowizoryczną bramę, zamkniętą na 
kłódkę, więc dostęp na szczyt był technicznie zabroniony (groziła za to kara do 2500 euro), ale wielu to nie powstrzymało przed 
obejściem ogrodzenie, wspinając się po zboczach z lewej strony. Pożary zniszczyły roślinność, 
która normalnie zapobiega osuwaniu się kamieni, więc przy deszczu i silnym wietrze warunki mogą być ryzykowne. Miałam spory 
dylemat, czy złamać zakaz i wejść na górę, gdyż pogoda była idealna, ale ostatecznie postanowiliśmy uszanować przepisy. To 
idealny pretekst, żeby kiedyś wrócić na tę piękną wyspę. Ponadto nasza poprzednia wędrówka na Pico Grande dała nam mnóstwo 
satysfakcji, widoki były równie spektakularne, a ludzi znacznie mniej. Dlatego nie czuliśmy się tak bardzo zdeterminowani, 
żeby koniecznie wejść na szczyt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09322.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09341.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09344.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09388.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cudowne widoki na tej trasie zaczynają się zaraz po opuszczeniu parkingu, z jednej strony wysokie szczyty, z drugiej w 
oddali morze. Często czytaliśmy w recenzjach, że w tym rejonie panują bardzo pochmurne warunki, ale nam trafił się niemal 
całkowicie bezchmurny dzień. Nadmorskie miejscowości pojawiały się i znikały między chmurami równie szybko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09383.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podczas przerwy w okolicach schroniska zauważyliśmy kilka zięb maderskich, które są bardzo powszechne na tej wyspie, zwłaszcza 
w lasach wawrzynowych i na terenach górzystych, takich jak szlak na Pico Ruivo. Ptaki te są ciekawskie i fotogeniczne, często 
zbliżają się blisko turystów, zwłaszcza w miejscach, gdzie są przyzwyczajone do obecności ludzi, a ten rejon zdecydowanie 
do takich należy. Schronisko widoczne na zdjęciu poniżej, usytuowane przy większej skale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09364.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09352.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naszą wędrówkę zakończyliśmy tuż po godzinie 10:00, kiedy parking był już prawie pełny. Sam szlak jest bardzo łatwy i 
odpowiedni dla większości osób z podstawową kondycją fizyczną, nawet dzieci mogą cieszyć się spacerem i podziwiać piękne 
widoki gór aż po Płw. Wawrzyńca w oddali (zdjęcie poniżej). To była najłatwiejsza trasa, jaką przeszliśmy na Maderze, 
głównie dzięki w pełni wybrukowanej ścieżce prowadzącej do schroniska i braku ekspozycji (przynajmniej do momentu, do którego 
dotarliśmy). Wyruszyliśmy tuż po 8:30 rano, więc jeszcze wtedy powietrze było bardzo przyjemne, pomimo pełnego słońca. 
Dokładnie, gdy wchodziliśmy na szlak, podjechali pracownicy parku, żeby sprawdzać bilety wstępu. Dokładnie o tej samej 
godzinie spotkaliśmy ich wchodzących na Płw. Wawrzyńca, więc to pewnie typowa dla nich pora, by zacząć pracę.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09355.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W drodze powrotnej z Achada do Teixeira zatrzymaliśmy się w &lt;strong&gt;Parque Temático da Madeira&lt;/strong&gt; w Santana. Okazało się, że to urocze, 
przyjazne rodzinom miejsce z tradycyjnymi maderskimi domkami. Można wejść do środka tych małych budynków i zobaczyć ekspozycje 
dotyczące historii, tradycji i przyrody Madery. Jest tam nawet tradycyjna kuchnia z piecem opalanym drewnem, w którym 
wypiekany jest słynny portugalski chleb z Madery, bolo do caco. Dodatkowo na terenie parku znajdują się piękne ogrody i 
wiele atrakcji dla dzieci, w tym duży plac zabaw, mini-zagroda ze zwierzętami oraz można popływać łódką po małym jeziorku. 
To spokojna alternatywa dla zatłoczonego centrum miasta i świetne miejsce na relaksującą wizytę, zwłaszcza z dziećmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09390.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09418.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09408.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/20241101_112627_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podstawowy bilet wstępu był niedrogi, a dodatkowe atrakcje płatne osobno, dlatego uznaliśmy park za doskonały przystanek 
przed dalszym zwiedzaniem wyspy. Samochód zostawiliśmy na darmowym parkingu przy obiekcie, skąd w kilkanaście minut spacerem 
dotarliśmy do centrum &lt;strong&gt;Santany&lt;/strong&gt;. 
W centrum miasta czekały na nas kolejne urocze, trójkątne domki ze strzechą, znane jako „Palheiros”. Większość z nich pełni
dziś funkcję sklepików z pamiątkami, ale ich bajkowy wygląd wciąż przyciąga uwagę. Tradycyjne domy z Santany słyną z 
intensywnych kolorów, białe ściany z czerwonymi drzwiami, niebieskimi framugami i stromym, krytym strzechą dachem. Początkowo 
były budowane przez rolników jako proste domy wiejskie, a charakterystyczny dach sięgający niemal do ziemi miał za zadanie 
odprowadzać wodę podczas ulewnych deszczy. Niektóre z oryginalnych domów pochodzą z XVI wieku, choć większość tych, które można dziś 
zobaczyć, to rekonstrukcje. Okolica jest bardzo zadbana, otoczona pięknymi ogrodami, a widoki na góry dookoła są naprawdę 
imponujące.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09436.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09445.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09454_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09452.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Próbowaliśmy również znaleźć miejsce, w którym serwują prego no bolo do caco, ale wiele dobrze ocenianych lokali było zamkniętych, 
a w jednym z otwartych zabrakło tych słynnych chlebków - bolo do caco, więc niestety nie udało nam się tego dania spróbować tego dania. Zatrzymaliśmy 
się więc w małym barze, gdzie na ekranie telewizora akurat relacjonowano gwałtowną powódź w Walencji, mieście, które odwiedziliśmy 
zaledwie kilka miesięcy wcześniej. Widok znajomych ulic zalanych błotem, wodą i zasypanych wrakami samochodów był poruszający.
W drodze do pobliskiej piekarni zauważyliśmy jeden domek, który wyglądał jak typowy kolorowy Palheiro, ale cały był brązowy,
zastanawialiśmy się, czy to może bardziej oryginalna lub po prostu jeszcze niepomalowana wersja. Niedaleko piekarni Delícias da Bia znajduje 
się też inny domek, który podobno można zwiedzać, to prywatny dom Casa típica de Santana, którego właściciel zaprasza turystów i opowiada o dziedzictwie 
rodzinnym. Nie ma tam biletu wstępu, ale mile widziane są datki (niestety nie weszliśmy do środka).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/20241101_130622.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podsumowując, Santana to świetny przystanek podczas zwiedzania tej części wyspy. Warto jednak pamiętać, że okolice centrum informacji 
turystycznej mogą być bardzo zatłoczone, dlatego polecamy przejść się nieco dalej, w stronę kościoła, a potem do piekarni,
aby zobaczyć bardziej autentyczną i spokojną stronę miasteczka, z dala od kilku domków skupionych wokół głównego placu, 
i przy okazji skosztować czegoś pysznego!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po opuszczeniu Santany postanowiliśmy zatrzymać się przy &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Guindaste&lt;/strong&gt;. Znajdują się tam dwie szklane platformy 
wychodzące nad klif, z których można obserwować rozbijające się fale. Bardziej podobało nam się to miejsce niż słynne Cabo 
Girão, gdzie również znajduje się szklany taras widokowy, położony wyżej nad wodą, ale szkło było tam tak porysowane, że 
widok nie zrobił na nas wrażenia, a tłumy były przytłaczające. Przy Miradouro do Guindaste nie było wielu osób, w okolicy 
nie ma zbyt wiele do zobaczenia, więc turyści zazwyczaj zatrzymują się tylko na chwilę i ruszają dalej. My przyjechaliśmy 
wczesnym popołudniem i bez problemu znaleźliśmy miejsce parkingowe. Warto poświęcić kilka dodatkowych minut na spacer ścieżkami 
wzdłuż krawędzi klifu, widoki na wybrzeże są zachwycające.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09469.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09464.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dzień zakończyliśmy krótkim odpoczynkiem na plaży &lt;strong&gt;Calhau da Lapa&lt;/strong&gt;. Zostawiliśmy samochód na pobliskiej ulicy i ruszyliśmy 
ścieżką, która po chwili zaczęła wyglądać na już nieużywaną, co szybko się potwierdziło gdyż, stawała się coraz bardziej zarośnięta 
przez ogromne kaktusy sięgające nam do uda i w końcu prowadziła przez głęboki wąwóz z przepływającym strumieniem. Na szczęście 
dno rzeki było wystarczająco suche, by dało się je przejść po kamieniach, i po małej przygodzie udało nam się wrócić na 
oficjalny szlak, z którego skorzystaliśmy w drodze powrotnej. Ten był znacznie łatwiejszy i kończył się w okolicy małego 
mostku na głównej drodze asfaltowej. Po drodze mijaliśmy wysoki, ale wąski wodospad, być może strużka wody była mniejsza 
niż zwykle z powodu braku deszczu w ostatnich dniach. Wodospad otoczony był ogromną ilością kaktusów a przed nim unosiła się 
tęcza, co wyglądało bardzo ciekawie. Widoki były niesamowite, a daleko w dole można było dostrzec plażę. Okoliczne wzgórza były 
całe porośnięte kaktusami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09504.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09485.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dostęp do plaży nie jest łatwy, prowadzą do niej bardzo strome schody, a różnica poziomów to około 160 metrów, ale nagroda 
w postaci spokoju i widoków jest tego warta. Po dotarciu na miejsce plaża wydała się opuszczona. Wszystkie kawiarenki i 
domy wykute w skałach były zabite deskami, a na miejscu było zaledwie kilka opalających się osób. Betonowy pomost z drabinką 
ułatwiał wejście do morza, ale cala plaza jest kamienista, wiec warto zabrać ze sobą buty do pływania. Ma to również i pozytywne strony
bo woda przez to jest krystalicznie czysta, a miedzy skałami biega mnóstwo kolorowych krabów. Bardzo szybko chowały się, reagując 
na każdy najmniejszy ruch, więc ich sfotografowanie okazało się nie lada wyzwaniem. Na zdjęciu poniżej widać w tle jak 
strome jest wzgórze z którego zeszliśmy na plażę.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09480.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To odosobnione i spokojne miejsce, bez tłumów, z przejrzystą wodą i mnóstwem krabów, było idealnym zakończeniem
dnia. Po wymagającym podejściu z powrotem na górę ruszyliśmy w stronę Funchal, oddaliśmy samochód i ruszyliśmy w kierunku
starego miasta na zasłużoną kolację.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informacje praktyczne:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

warto sprawdzić, czy szlaki turystyczne są otwarte po pożarach, które miały miejsce latem 2024 roku.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilety na szlaki płatne można kupić online na &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;tej stronie.&lt;/a&gt;
Od 1 stycznia 2025 roku osoby niebędące rezydentami muszą płacić za wstęp na ponad 30 tras zarządzanych przez Instytut Lasów 
i Ochrony Przyrody (ICNF) na Maderze. Praktycznie wszystkie szlaki oznaczone jako PR podlegają opłacie&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;W czasie naszej wizyty otwarty był jedynie odcinek z Achada do Teixeira do schroniska Casa de Abrigo do Pico Ruivo (2,4 km), 
podczas gdy cała trasa ma 2,8 km. Więcej informacji znajduje się &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/images/FotosArtigos/ActivNatureza/PercPedRecom/Paineis_Net/pr1.2.jpg&quot;&gt;na oficjalnej stronie.&lt;/a&gt;
Końcowy fragment, oferujący najpiękniejsze widoki, był zamknięty. Szlak blokowało wysokie ogrodzenie, jednak większość osób 
nielegalnie je obchodziła zboczem, mimo ryzyka mandatu w wysokości 2500€. W okolicy nie było jednak żadnych strażników. 
Strażnicy obecni byli jedynie przy parkingu, gdzie sprawdzali bilety wstępu w cenie 3€.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parque Temático da Madeira – Podstawowy bilet wstępu kosztuje 3€. Dodatkowe atrakcje dla dzieci to koszt 3–4€ każda, 
lub można kupić bilet łączony za 12€. Przy samym parku znajduje się duży, bezpłatny parking (zostawiliśmy tam samochód i 
przeszliśmy pieszo do centrum miasteczka, zaledwie 520m do ratusza). Uwaga: korzystanie z toalet jest dodatkowo płatne 
(0,50 €). Zwiedzanie parku zajmuje około półtorej godziny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro do Guindaste - mały punkt widokowy z bezpłatnym parkingiem oraz dostępem do publicznej toalety.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09471.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calhau da Lapa - Zaparkowaliśmy przy drodze, w pobliżu mostu, gdzie zaczyna się szlak Caminho do Passo. Obecnie ścieżka 
prowadząca na plażę jest zamknięta z powodu spadających odłamków skalnych (według najnowszych recenzji na Google Maps z 
wiosny 2025 roku). W okolicy plaży nie ma żadnych udogodnień, wszystkie kawiarnie i domy w jaskiniach są zabite deskami. 
Szlak jest bardzo stromy, z przewyższeniem około 160 m, więc powrót pod górę może być naprawdę wyczerpujący w upalne dni.

        <title>Madeira Adventure: Day 5 - Pico Ruivo, colorful Santana and deserted beach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We were hesitating about how to spend our last day with the car, and ultimately decided to go for a walk to Pico Ruivo in the morning.
During our stay in November 2024, the official website stated that only the section up to the shelter was open. However, 
this was confusing to me, since many new reviews on Google maps had been added with photos from the peak. We assumed we would be able to 
reach the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful hike, but sadly the top (the last 400 meters) was closed due to wildfire damage. The fires had weakened 
the soil, making it dangerous. Still, most people were bypassing the fence by scrambling up the slopes on the left. The 
gate was closed and locked, so technically, access to the summit was prohibited (with fines up to €2,500) but that didn’t stop many from going around 
it. The wildfires had destroyed vegetation that normally helps prevent falling rocks, so with rain and wind, the conditions 
can be risky. I was really torn about whether to break the rules and go to the summit, but in the end, we respected the 
rules. It’s the perfect excuse to return one day to this beautiful island. Our hike to Pico Grande felt even more 
rewarding, since views were as stunning as here but it was less crowded. Therefore, we already felt truly fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09322.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09341.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09344.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09388.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start admiring Madeira in all its splendor right after leaving the parking area with high peaks 
on one side and the sea in the distance on the other. We had often read reviews mentioning very cloudy conditions in this area, 
but our day was almost completely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09383.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While taking a break near the shelter, we spotted many Madeiran chaffinches, which are very common in Madeira, especially 
in the laurel forests and mountainous areas like the trail to Pico Ruivo. These birds are curious and photogenic, often 
hopping close to hikers, particularly in areas where they’re used to people and this is definitely a busy area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09364.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09352.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished our hike shortly after 10 a.m., at which time the parking lot was almost full.
The trail itself is very easy and suitable for most people with a basic level of fitness, so even children can enjoy it and 
get a chance to see beautiful mountain views as far as the São Lourenço Peninsula in the distance (photo below). It was the easiest 
hike we did on Madeira, mostly thanks to the fully paved path leading to the shelter and no exposure (at least to the point we did). 
We started just after 8 a.m., which was very pleasant, as it wasn’t too hot yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09355.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back from Achada do Teixeira, we stopped at &lt;strong&gt;Parque Temático da Madeira&lt;/strong&gt; in Santana. It turned out to be a lovely, 
family-friendly spot with traditional Madeiran houses. You can enter these little houses and see displays about Madeira’s history, traditions, and natural heritage.
There’s even a traditional kitchen with an old wood‑fired oven making Santana’s famous bread. Additionally, there were 
beautiful gardens, and plenty of attractions for children, including 
a large playground, a small farm, and even a boat ride. It’s a peaceful alternative to the busy town center and a great 
place for a relaxed visit, especially with kids. The entrance fee for the garden area was affordable and perfect for a 
slow-paced stroll among the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09390.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09418.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09408.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/20241101_112627_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we left the car in the parking lot next to the theme park, it was convenient to take a short walk to Santana’s town 
center, where more of the charming, triangular-shaped straw‑roofed houses known as “Palheiros” were waiting for us. Most of 
them are now used as souvenir shops, but their fairytale-like appearance remains.
These traditional Santana houses are famous for their bright colours, typically white walls with red doors, blue frames, 
and steep thatched roofs. They were originally built by farmers as simple rural houses, with the thatched roof extending 
almost to the ground to channel rainwater away from the roof. Some of the original houses date back to the 16th century, 
although most of what you see today are reconstructions or preserved examples.
The area is well-maintained, surrounded by beautiful gardens, and the mountain views all around are incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09436.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09445.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09454_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09452.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also tried to find a place serving prego no bolo do caco, but many of the well-reviewed spots were closed, and the one 
that was open had run out of the special bread rolls, so unfortunately, we couldn’t try it there.
I remember standing in this small bar, watching the news on TV, footage of the floods that had just happened in Valencia, 
a city we had visited a few months earlier (see more details here).
On the way to a nearby bakery, we spotted one house which looked like the typical colorful Palheiros but was entirely brown, 
and we wondered if that might be a more original or unpainted version. There’s also another house close to the bakery 
Delícias da Bia that you can apparently visit, it’s a private home whose owner opens it for tourists and explains the family heritage. There’s 
no entrance fee, but donations are welcome (unfortunately, we didn’t enter inside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/20241101_130622.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Santana is a great quick stop while exploring the nearby region. However, the area around the tourist information 
center can be very crowded, so we’d recommend walking a bit further, toward the church and then to the bakery to see a 
more authentic and peaceful side of the town beyond the few houses clustered around the main square and to try some baked 
goodies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Santana, we decided to stop at &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Guindaste&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two glass platforms extending over 
the cliffs from where you can watch the waves crashing. We liked it more than Cabo Girão that also had glass skywalk that
was higher above the water but glass was scratched so much that view did not excite us and crowd was overwhelming. We 
didn’t see many people here, but there isn’t much around the viewpoint so tourists just stop for a couple of minutes and leave.
We arrived early in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a spot. Take a few extra minutes to explore the cliff edge trails, 
the views of the coastline are stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09469.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09464.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended our day with some quiet time on the beach, &lt;strong&gt;Calhau da Lapa&lt;/strong&gt;. We parked the car and started following a path that 
seemed to be an old one, apparently no longer in use, which we realized as it got worse and worse, overgrown by huge 
cactuses and eventually leading through a deep gorge with water. Luckily, the riverbed was dry enough to cross, and after a 
bit of an adventure, we rejoined the official trail, which we used for the way back. That one was much easier and ended near a small bridge.
On the way, there was a tall but 
narrow waterfall, perhaps smaller than usual due to the lack of rain in recent days, surrounded by a huge number of cactuses
with visible rainbow in front. 
The views were amazing, and you could see the beach far below in the distance. The surrounding area was full of cactus-covered slopes.
The beach is not easily accessible, very steep stairs leading there with about 160 meters of descent, but the reward is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09504.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/20241101_150708_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09485.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beach looked deserted, 
all the cafés and cave 
houses were boarded up, and there were just a few people sunbathing. It’s possible to swim in the crystal-clear water, but 
swimming shoes are recommended due to the huge and sharp rocks. A concrete pontoon with a ladder gave easy access to the sea.
There were plenty of cool-looking crabs, but they hid so quickly, reacting to even the slightest movement, which made it 
challenging to take photos of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day5/DSC09480.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This remote and peaceful location, not overcrowded, with clear water and plenty of
crabs, was a perfect last stop for the day. After the walk back up, we hit the road toward Funchal, returned our rental car, 
and treated ourselves to a well-deserved dinner in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

to check if hiking trails are open after the wildfires that occurred during the summer of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tickets for paid hiking trails can be bought online &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;on this website.&lt;/a&gt;
From January 1, 2025, non-residents will need to pay to hike on over 30 routes managed by the Institute of Forests and 
Nature Conservation (ICNF) in Madeira. These are basically all hikes marked as PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time of our visit, only the section from Achada do Teixeira to the Casa de Abrigo do Pico Ruivo shelter (2.4 km) 
was open, while the total route is 2.8 km. More information can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/images/FotosArtigos/ActivNatureza/PercPedRecom/Paineis_Net/pr1.2.jpg&quot;&gt;on the official website&lt;/a&gt;
The final part, which offers the most spectacular views, was closed. The path was blocked by a high fence, but most people 
were illegally bypassing it along the slope, despite the risk of a €2,500 fine. However, there were no park rangers in 
the area. Rangers were only present at the parking lot, checking the €3 entry tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parque Temático da Madeira – Basic entry fee is €3. Additional activities for children cost €3–4 each, or there’s an 
all-in pass available for €12. A large, free parking lot is located right next to the park (we left our car there and 
walked to the city center, just 520 m to the town hall). Note: there’s an extra fee for using the restrooms (€0.50). 
Visiting the park takes about an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro do Guindaste - small viewpoint with free parking and public toilets available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calhau da Lapa - We parked along the road near the bridge where the Caminho do Passo trail begins. Currently, the path 
to the beach is closed due to falling rocks (according to recent Google Maps reviews from spring 2025). There are no 
facilities near the beach; all cafés and cave houses are boarded up. The trail is very steep, with about 160 m of descent
so the climb back up can be really exhausting on warm days.

        <title>Przygoda na Maderze: Dzień 4 - Pico Grande</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Już od samego rana roznosiła mnie energia, bo wiedziałam, że cały dzień spędzimy w górach, pokonując strome podejścia na 
Pico Grande, drugi co do wysokości szczyt na Maderze. Jest to jeden z mniej uczęszczanych wierzchołków wyspy, a trasa 
prowadząca na jego szczyt, którą wybraliśmy, to tzw. bieg wertykalny (vertical kilometer), który znalazłam na oficjalnej 
stronie turystyki Madery. Najbardziej popularny szlak na ten szczyt był nadal zamknięty po pożarach. Trasa ma sumę przewyższeń 
około 1000 metrów na dystansie niespełna 5 km. Pogoda zapowiadała się znakomicie, więc nie mogliśmy sobie wymarzyć lepszych 
warunków. Z plecakami pełnymi przekąsek ruszyliśmy w drogę, gotowi na obcowanie z naturą. To, co ujrzeliśmy, przeszło 
nasze oczekiwania!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W drodze do punktu startowego wędrówki zatrzymaliśmy się na &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro da Eira do Serrado&lt;/strong&gt;, gdzie dotarliśmy krótko po ósmej 
rano. Na punkcie widokowym była, oprócz nas, tylko jedna osoba i to sprawiło, że czuliśmy się tam naprawdę wyjątkowo, 
obserwując w ciszy dopiero co budzącą się do życia Dolinę Zakonnic (Curral das Freiras), otuloną stromymi górami. W porannym 
świetle wyglądało to absolutnie oszałamiająco. Pico Grande nie było widoczne z powodu chmur zawieszonych wciaz nad szczytami. Już 
wtedy zauważyliśmy, że większość stoków miała bardzo ciemny lub wrecz czarny kolor, co tylko potwierdziło, że letnie pożary z sierpnia 2024 roku 
wywarły poważny wpływ na lokalną przyrodę w tej dolinie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na miejscu znajduje się także hotel, kawiarnia, restauracja i sklep z pamiątkami. Pierwszy autobus z turystami dotarł 
o 8:30, gdy właśnie ruszaliśmy z parkingu, więc bardzo się ucieszyłam, że nie spotkaliśmy go na jednym z ostrych zakrętów. 
Jest to łatwo dostępny punkt widokowy gdzie prowadzi kilku minutowy spacer z bezpłatnego parkingu, położony na wysokości 1095 m n.p.m. 
Z punktu widokowego prowadzi też ścieżka do wioski &lt;strong&gt;Curral das Freiras&lt;/strong&gt;. Wiem, że niektórzy turyści biorą autobus z Funchal do tego 
punktu widokowego, schodzą ścieżką do wioski, podziwiając piękne góry dookoła, i wracają do Funchal z Curral das Freiras. 
Jest to możliwe, ale trzeba wyruszyć z Funchal wcześnie rano. Zauważyliśmy na rozkładzie jazdy, że popołudniowych połączeń autobusowych jest 
mniej. Mimo to widzieliśmy ludzi czekających na przystanku, gdy jedliśmy obiad we wczesnych godzinach popołudniowych 
(autobus nr 81), więc autobusy są choć być może trzeba będzie trochę poczekać na powrót do Funchal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na pierwszym zdjęciu poniżej widać odległą dzielnicę Curral das Freiras, gdzie rozpoczęliśmy wędrówkę na Pico Grande, to 
ostatnie skupisko domów u samej góry zdjęcia. Pośrodku widoczna jest główna część wioski, w której zatrzymaliśmy się po 
wędrówce na obiad i przypadkowo trafiliśmy w sam środek dorocznego Święta Kasztanów! W dolinie można skosztować lokalnych 
specjałów, w tym likierów o różnych smakach oraz rozmaitych produktów bazujących na jadalnych kasztanach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_082551.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_082606.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po krótkiej jeździe do najdalszej dzielnicy Curral das Freiras znaleźliśmy miejsce parkingowe, które wcześniej zaznaczyłam 
na Google Maps, i byliśmy gotowi rozpocząć wędrówkę. Pierwszy odcinek prowadził przez wioskę do „Caminho de Fajã Escura à 
Revinha”, punktu początkowego naszej trasy, gdzie zauważyliśmy drewnianą tablicę wskazującą drogę na &lt;strong&gt;Pico Grande&lt;/strong&gt;. Szlak 
zaczynał się w pięknym lesie z wysokimi drzewami, opadłymi liśćmi i już widocznymi śladami pożaru: spalonymi drzewami, z których 
niektóre duże fragmenty leżały na ścieżce, oraz poczerniałą ziemią. Minęły zaledwie trzy miesiące od pożarów, a przyroda 
już zaczynała się odradzać, jako pierwsze pojawiały się przede wszystkim młode paprocie o soczystych odcieniach zieleni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_093351_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_093727_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_095913_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_094133_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ścieżka szybko stała się dość stroma i wraz z coraz niższymi drzewami, bardziej otwarta, przez co widoki zaczęły nas coraz
bardziej zachwycać. Na trasie nie było widać żadnych innych odgałęzień szlaku wiec nie dało się tam zgubić i trasa technicznie 
była bardzo łatwa. Teren nieco się wyrównał dopiero w punkcie widokowym Relvinha, gdzie przebiega szlak &lt;strong&gt;Caminho 
Real da Encumeada (PR12)&lt;/strong&gt;, który można by było wykorzystać jako alternatywę do naszej trasy na Pico Grande (widać go na 
drugim zdjęciu poniżej). Niestety, PR12 był zamknięty podczas naszego pobytu. Obecnie szlak jest częściowo otwarty, 
według oficjalnej strony, dostępny jest jedynie pierwszy 3,5km odcinek od punktu startowego Boca da Corrida. Oznacza to, że można 
dotrzeć aż do Relvinha, szacując odległość przy pomocy aplikacji Organic Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten punkt widokowy to było pierwsze miejsce, gdzie ujrzeliśmy tak ogromne skutki pożarów. Czarne zbocza, ogromne drzewa, 
z których został tylko popiół. Serce się krajało na ten widok, a zapach spalonego krajobrazu był nadal bardzo intensywny. 
Od tego momentu szlak stał się bardziej techniczny, na stromych zboczach pojawiły się zabezpieczenia, a podłoże było 
pokryte luźnymi kamieniami. Niektóre odcinki były mokre, pomimo że dotychczas szlak był bardzo suchy, więc w deszczowy dzień 
mogło tam być naprawdę ślisko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_103342.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09233.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09232.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09277.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po pokonaniu stromego zbocza dotarliśmy na płaskowyż, gdzie ścieżka stała się mniej oczywista. Widać było ślady kilku różnych 
tras, ale wszystkie prowadziły w tym samym kierunku. Sprawdziliśmy naszą pozycję w telefonie, ale już stąd mogliśmy dostrzec 
charakterystyczny kształt szczytu Pico Grande. Wiatr się wzmógł, a chmury zaczęły szybko przemieszczać się wokół nas. Naprawdę czuliśmy 
się, jakbyśmy byli na innej planecie. Przez krótkie chwile byliśmy całkowicie otoczeni mgłą i nie widzieliśmy zbyt wiele, 
tylko ciemną i czerwoną ziemię pod stopami. Poniżej znajduje się widok z płaskowyżu w pobliżu szczytu, skąd mogliśmy dostrzec 
wioskę w okolicach naszego punktu startowego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09250.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09246.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podejście było niesamowicie strome, ale absolutnie tego warte! Na sam wierzchołek, z którego roztacza sie 360-stopniowa panorama
prowadzi wąska ścieżka po skalach. Na zdjęciu poniżej, szczyt może wyglądać na dość płaski, ale w 
rzeczywistości wcale taki nie jest. Była tam lina, której można się było przytrzymać, a ekspozycja po drugiej stronie skały 
robiła wrażenie. Na końcu trzeba wyjść na mały wypłaszczony wierzchołek wiec osoby z lekiem wysokości nie beda się tam czuć komfortowo
(wejście na wierzchołek można sobie odpuścić, bo widoki te kilka matrów niżej są już świetne). Pomimo tego, że nie weszliśmy na 
sam szczyt, gorąco polecamy tą wędrówkę! Na całym szlaku spotkaliśmy łącznie około 15 osób, w tym kilku biegaczy górskich. 
Ogólnie, przy deszczowej pogodzie trasa może być miejscami trudna i 
niebezpieczna. Odpowiednie buty trekkingowe są zdecydowanie obowiązkowe, jak i dodatkowe okrycie, bo wyżej było już bardziej 
wietrznie i warunki pogodowe zmieniały się bardzo szybko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09257.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po zakończeniu wędrówki zatrzymaliśmy się w Curral das Freiras na lunch w restauracji, która serwowała dania z jadalnych 
kasztanów. Spróbowaliśmy zupy kasztanowej, mięsa z nadzieniem kasztanowym i z sosem kasztanowym, niesamowicie smacznych 
lokalnych batatów, tradycyjnego chleba z batatów (podawanego z masłem czosnkowym) oraz grillowanych warzyw. Chleb doskonale 
pasował do mojej zupy, prosty, chrupiący z zewnątrz, a w środku puszysty i ciepły. Z tarasu restauracji mieliśmy doskonały 
widok na Pico Grande, wreszcie chmury całkowicie się rozeszły, a niebo zupełnie się otworzyło.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_152626_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_154435.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta mała wioska wciąż nie była zatłoczona w tych wczesnych godzinach popołudniowych, ale i tak musieliśmy zaparkować zadłuż ulicy, 
poza głównym centrum wioski. Przy kościele ustawiona była scena, a wzdłuż głównej drogi stały stoiska z jedzeniem wiec ulica 
praktycznie nie była przejezdna. Ludzie przygotowywali się do dorocznego Święta Kasztanów, &lt;strong&gt;Festa da Castanha&lt;/strong&gt;. Była to dla nas całkowita niespodzianka
ale jaka miła! Festiwal odbywa się co roku w Curral das Freiras, zazwyczaj w weekend przypadający blisko 1 listopada.
Ludzie sprzedawali likiery, ciasta i inne przysmaki z kasztanów. Odwiedziliśmy też lokalną piekarnię, żeby spróbować tutejszych 
wypieków, a potem zauważyliśmy, że w ramach festiwalu zaplanowano również wieczorne wydarzenie, konkurs „Miss Castanha”, 
czyli wybory Królowej Kasztanów. Widzieliśmy wiele stoisk z jedzeniem, na których wisiały całe świnie, ustawione były grille i domowej roboty
likiery w dużych plastikowych butelkach, wszystko dopiero było przygotowywane na wieczorną imprezę.
Spróbowaliśmy też pysznych pieczonych kasztanów, przygotowywanych na otwartym ogniu. Pieczone kasztany są lekko słodkie, a 
ich konsystencja przypomina coś pomiędzy miękkim nerkowcem a bardzo mączystą, gęstą fasolą. Żałuję, że nie zostaliśmy aż 
do wieczora, ale bałam się wracać do Funchal po zmroku, bo droga nie należy do najłatwiejszych.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09315.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To była bardzo przyjemna wioska, idealna na popołudniowy odpoczynek po wymagającej wędrowce, pełna sklepików z pamiątkami, kolorowych dekoracji i pysznego jedzenia.
Jak dotąd był to dla mnie najlepszy dzień na Maderze i prawie ostatni, bo w planach mieliśmy już tylko jeden dzień by zobaczyć 
Pico do Areeiro, kolorową wioskę Santana i mniej znana plażę Calhau da Lapa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informacje praktyczne:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

na wyspie latem 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro da Eira do Serrado - brak opłaty za wstęp, bardzo kręta droga na ostatnich kilku kilometrach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Punkt początkowy naszej wędrówki znajdował się na końcu Estrada do Colmeal, oznaczony na Google Maps jako Caminho de Fajã 
Escura à Revinha, gdzie zmieszczą się dwa-trzy samochody. Ponieważ nie byliśmy pewni, czy będą tam wolne miejsca, zostawiliśmy 
nasz samochód na małym parkingu w wiosce (współrzędne poniżej) i poszliśmy pieszo. Ten parking znajduje się poniżej 
głównej drogi, więc nie jest widoczny z daleka, ale może pomieścić około ośmiu samochodów. Podczas spaceru przez wioskę
zauważyliśmy przystanki autobusowe z rozkładem jazdy linii 81. Udało mi się nawet znaleźć rozkład jazdy online: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.horariosdofunchal.pt/carreiras/81.pdf&quot;&gt;line 81&lt;/a&gt; 
ale nie do końca zrozumiałam, kiedy autobus jedzie do Fajã Escura-Final (CF19J), przystanku który mijaliśmy po drodze.&lt;br /&gt;
Adres parkingu: 32°44’08.5”N 16°58’09.6”W&lt;br /&gt;
Inne miejsce do zaparkowania (do 5 samochodów, widoczne w Street View): 32°43’55.6”N 16°58’14.9”W&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Podczas naszych podróży zawsze korzystamy z aplikacji &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation app&lt;/a&gt;, 
która na Maderze sprawdziła się doskonale, ani razu się nie zgubiliśmy. Nasza wędrówka miała 10 km długości i przewyższenie 
1000 metrów (zaczynaliśmy na wysokości nieco ponad 600 m n.p.m., a skończyliśmy na 1654 m). Dotarcie na szczyt zajęło nam 
prawie 2 godziny, a zejście 1,5 godziny (łączny czas ruchu: 2 godziny 15 minut), choć całość trwała 5 godzin, bo robiliśmy 
kilka dłuższych przerw. Opis szlaku można znaleźć na oficjalnej stronie jako &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/en/what-to-do/nature-seekers/activities/trail-running/quilometro-vertical-de-camara-de-lobos/&quot;&gt;bieg wertykalny&lt;/a&gt; 
ponieważ różnica wysokości między początkiem a końcem trasy to nieco ponad 1000 m. Miałam na sobie buty Salewa Wildfire, 
były idealne na tę wędrówkę!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Festiwal Kasztanów odbędzie sie również w tym roku: 31.10.2025 – 01.11.2025. Scena z muzyką i konkursem została ustawiona obok Igreja 
Matriz do Curral das Freiras. Cała ulica Estr. Cónego Camacho była zapełniona straganami. W związku z tym nie było 
dostępnych miejsc parkingowych przy tej ulicy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restaurant  - Sabores do Curral. Warto, przyjemne miejsce i jedzenie nam bardzo smakowało!  &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Madeira Adventure: Day 4 - Pico Grande</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was so excited about the day ahead! Pure hiking to one of the less touristy peaks on the island, and a vertical kilometer
to do, that was the plan for today. The weather looked amazing, so we couldn’t have wished for more. With snacks packed 
for the day, we hit the road, ready for the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop of the day was &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro da Eira do Serrado&lt;/strong&gt;, which we reached shortly after 8 a.m. The first bus 
with tourists arrived at 8:30, just as we were leaving. There was only one other person at the viewpoint, it was a truly 
special experience to see the whole Nuns’ Valley (Curral das Freiras) nestled among steep mountains. It was absolutely 
stunning in the morning light.
Pico Grande wasn’t visible due to clouds suspended above the peaks. We already noticed that most of the slopes were quite 
black, which only confirmed that the summer wildfires of August 2024 had left a significant impact on the local ecology.
There is also a café, restaurant, and souvenir shop in hotel. It’s an easily accessible viewpoint, just 
a short walk from the free parking lot, located at an altitude of 1,095 m above sea level. There’s also a path starting at 
the viewpoint that leads to &lt;strong&gt;Curral das Freiras&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people take a bus to this viewpoint from Funchal, do the hike, and return to Funchal from Curral das Freiras, 
which is possible, but you’d need to start the trip early in the morning. It seemed there were fewer bus connections in 
the afternoon. However, we did see people waiting at the bus stop when we had lunch in the early afternoon (bus 81), so 
there are buses, but you might need to wait a bit longer to get back to Funchal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first photo below, the distant part of Curral das Freiras where we started the hike to Pico Grande is visible as the last group of houses 
at the top of the picture. In the middle, the main part of the village where we stopped after the hike for lunch and by accident 
found ourselves in the middle of the yearly Chestnut Festival! In the valley, you can taste local delicacies, including 
liqueurs in many flavors and various products based on edible chestnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_082551.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_082606.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short drive to the furthest district of Curral das Freiras, we found the parking spot I had previously marked on 
Google Maps and were ready to start our hike. The first part led us through the village to Caminho de Fajã Escura à Revinha, 
the starting point of our route, where we noticed a wooden board pointing the way to &lt;strong&gt;Pico Grande&lt;/strong&gt;. The trail began in a 
beautiful forest with tall trees, fallen leaves, and already visible signs of fire damage, burned trees (some large pieces 
on the path) and blackened soil. It was just three months after the wildfires, and nature was already beginning to recover, 
with young ferns emerging first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_093351_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_093727_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_095913_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_094133_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path quickly became quite steep and, with fewer trees, more exposed. It was easy to follow and not technically difficult, 
but physically demanding. The terrain didn’t flatten until we reached the Relvinha viewing spot, where the Caminho Real 
da Encumeada Hike (PR12) passes by, though it’s not part of the hike to Pico Grande (visible in the middle photo below). 
Unfortunately, PR12 is still only partially open after the fires, only the first 3.5 km from the Boca da Corrida starting 
point, according to the official website. That would be up to Relvinha, based on organic maps. This was our first glimpse 
of the devastating impact of the fires. Black slopes, huge trees reduced to ashes. It was heartbreaking to see, and the 
smell of the burned landscape was still strong. The path from here became more technical, with some protection on the steep 
slopes, which were exposed and covered in loose rocks. Some parts were wet, despite the recent dry weather, so it might 
get really slippery on a rainy day. Up until this point, the trail had been very dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_103342.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09233.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09232.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09277.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After traversing the steep slope, we reached a plateau where the path became less obvious. There were traces of multiple 
routes, but all led in the same direction. We checked our position on the phone, but from here we could already see the 
peak`s distinctive shape. The wind picked up and clouds started to pass quickly around us. We truly felt like we 
were on another planet. For brief moments, we were completely surrounded by mist and couldn’t see much, just the dark 
and red soil under our feet. Below is the view from the plateau near the peak, from where we could see the village near 
our starting point. The hike was incredibly steep, but absolutely worth it! The last part, to get to the peak itself is a bit unusual, you have to 
climb to get to the very top. It looks flat in the photo below, but it really isn’t. There was a rope to hold onto, and the exposure on 
the other side of the rock was impressive. In the end, it’s a bit sketchy, if you’re uncomfortable going up to the 
very top (like us), don’t (we didn’t either). But I still highly recommend this hike! In total, there were just under 15 people on the trail. 
Overall, on rainy days, the hike may be difficult and dangerous in places. Proper trekking shoes are definitely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09257.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09246.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the hike, we stopped in Curral das Freiras for lunch at a restaurant featuring edible chestnuts. We tried chestnut 
soup, meat with chestnut filling and sauce, incredibly good local sweet potatoes, traditional sweet potato bread (served 
with garlic butter), and grilled vegetables. The bread perfectly accompanied my soup. Simple, crispy on the outside, and 
fluffy and warm on the inside. From the restaurant’s terrace, we could clearly see Pico Grande, the clouds had completely 
disappeared, and the sky had opened up.
This small village was still not overcrowded (it was early afternoon), but we had to park on the street, outside the central parking area, because there 
was a stage set up next to the church and food stands lining the main road. People were preparing for the annual Chestnut 
Festival (Festa da Castanha). It was a complete surprise for us, but such a great one! The festival takes place each year 
in Curral das Freiras, typically around November 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_152626_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/20241031_154435.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were selling liqueurs, cakes, and other delicacies made from chestnuts. We also visited a local bakery to try some 
pastries, and then we noticed an evening event, the “Miss Castanha” (Chestnut Queen) contest, held as part of the festivities.
We saw many food stands with whole pigs hanging in the back, barbecues, and stalls selling liqueurs, all just being set 
up, probably for the evening party. I also tried 
delicious chestnuts, roasted over an open fire. Roasted chestnuts are slightly sweet, with a texture somewhere between a 
soft cashew and very starchy, dense beans. I regret that we didn’t stay until the evening, but I was too scared of driving back 
to Funchal in the dark, as the road is not easy. It was a very pleasant village to stop in, full of souvenir shops, colorful 
decorations, and great food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09314.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day4/DSC09315.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, it was the best day for me on Madeira, and almost the last one, as we had only one more day planned for Pico do 
Areeiro, the colorful village of Santana, and Calhau da Lapa beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro da Eira do Serrado - no entrance fee, very zigzag-y road last few kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/pt/atividades-de-natureza/percursos-pedestres-recomendados/percursos-pedestres-recomendados.html&quot;&gt;Official website&lt;/a&gt; 
to check if hiking trails are open after the wildfires that occurred during the summer last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point for the hike was at the end of Estrada do Colmeal, marked on Google Maps as &lt;strong&gt;Caminho de Fajã Escura à Revinha&lt;/strong&gt;, 
where there is space for about two cars to park. Since we weren’t sure whether there would be any parking spots available, 
we left our car in a small parking area in the village (coordinates below) and walked from there. This parking lot is located 
below the main road, so it’s not visible from a distance ,it can accommodate around eight cars. While walking through the village, 
we noticed bus stops with the Bus 81 schedule posted. I even found it online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.horariosdofunchal.pt/carreiras/81.pdf&quot;&gt;line 81&lt;/a&gt; 
but I couldn’t really understand when the bus goes to Fajã Escura-Final (CF19J), the bus stop we passed on the way. &lt;br /&gt;
Address of the parking: 32°44’08.5”N 16°58’09.6”W  &lt;br /&gt;
Another stop to part (up to 5 cars, visible on street view): 32°43’55.6”N 16°58’14.9”W&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During our travels, we always use &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation app&lt;/a&gt;, which was very accurate 
on Madeira, we didn’t get lost even once. Our hike was 10km, 1000m up (we started at attitude of a bit more than 600m and 
finished at altitude of 1654 meters). It took almost 2 hours to reach the peak and 1.5h to get back (2h15min moving time of the
whole activity), though total time was 5 hours as we took a few long breaks during the hike. The trail we did is described
on official website as &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/en/what-to-do/nature-seekers/activities/trail-running/quilometro-vertical-de-camara-de-lobos/&quot;&gt;vertical kilometer&lt;/a&gt; 
because the difference in attitude between starting point and finish is slightly more than 1000m. I used Salewa Wildfire shoes 
and these were just perfect for this hike!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chestnut Festival again this year: &lt;strong&gt;31/10/2025 - 01/11/2025&lt;/strong&gt;, stage with music and competition was set up next to Igreja Matriz 
do Curral das Freiras. The whole street Estr. Cónego Camacho was full of market stalls. Therefore, parking spots on this 
street were not available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restaurant  - Sabores do Curral &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Przygoda na Maderze: Dzień 3 – Odkrywanie piękna dzikiego zachodniego wybrzeża.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Każdego wieczoru planowaliśmy szczegółowo kolejny dzień, uwzględniając pogodę oraz nasze zmęczenie (chcieliśmy uniknąć 
najtrudniejszych wędrówek dwa dni z rzędu). Prognoza na następny dzień była najbardziej stabilna, więc postanowiliśmy wykorzystać 
to na wędrówkę na Pico Grande, która miała być najbardziej wymagającą podczas tych wakacji. Dzisiejszy dzień miał być 
za to mniej męczący, 9-kilometrowy szlak jedną z lewad oraz dłuższa przejażdżka wzdłuż zachodniego wybrzeża wyspy, z 
wieloma przystankami na punktach widokowych. Ostatnim celem na dzisiejszy dzień miało być Porto Moniz, gdzie znajdują się słynne naturalne baseny. 
Wszystko zajęło nam więcej czasu, niż planowaliśmy, więc wracaliśmy do Funchal już po zachodzie słońca (czego do tej pory 
bardzo unikałam). Jednak droga przez wewnętrzną część wyspy (VE4) jest dość łatwa, ruch wieczorem był niewielki, a jazda 
przyjemna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wracając do poranka, rozpoczęliśmy naszą wędrówkę w Ponta do Sol, a za cel obraliśmy najpierw &lt;strong&gt;Levada do Moinho&lt;/strong&gt;. Ta 
lewada była bardzo łatwa i dobrze utrzymana. Dość mokra w niektórych miejscach, mijająca małe wodospady oraz rzekę, gdzie 
po chwili odpoczynku, zaczęliśmy wspinaczkę po schodach, aby dotrzeć do kolejnej lewady &lt;strong&gt;Levada Nova&lt;/strong&gt;, która do tej 
pory przez cały czas znajdowała się powyżej nas i ta właśnie zamierzaliśmy wracać. W tej okolicy zauważyliśmy po raz pierwszy ślady po zeszłorocznych pożarach 
i nowe paprocie przebijające się przez popiół spalonego lasu, przywracając życie temu miejscu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08973.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08958.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08997.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09002.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na początku szlak był bardzo łatwy i prowadził do spektakularnych wodospadów, niekoniecznie wysokich czy ogromnych, ale 
można było przejść za nimi, co stanowiło atrakcję samą w sobie. Kurtka przeciwdeszczowa jest wysoce zalecana, ponieważ na 
obu lewadach znajdują się bardziej mokre odcinki z wodą kapiącą z górnych części wzgórz i roślin znajdujących się nad 
ścieżką. Później na trasie był również dość długi tunel, ale światło z telefonu wystarczyło, aby przez niego przejść.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po wyjściu z tunelu otworzył się przed naszymi oczami widok na ogromny wąwóz, którego przejście potem okazało się najbardziej 
stresującym momentem wszystkich wędrówek na Maderze. Nie pamiętam, kiedy ostatnio byłam tak sparaliżowana strachem, chyba 
podczas wspinaczki skalnej we Francji kilka lat temu. Nie mam silnego lęku wysokości, ale nie przepadam za lataniem, a 
pierwszy lot paralotnią okazał się dla mnie zbyt stresujący, aby go kiedyś powtórzyć. Lubię jednak wędrować po wysokich 
górach i pokonywać techniczne, skaliste odcinki, w przeciwieństwie do mojego męża. Jednak tym razem naprawdę trudno było mi
zmusić się do zrobienia kolejnego kroku w pewnym miejscu, zaraz po minięciu tunelu, gdzie barierki ochronne były poważnie 
uszkodzone lub ich w ogóle nie było.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co najmniej połowa trasy nie ma poręczy, a sama ścieżka to jedynie 30-centymetrowa betonowa lewada, kończąca się pionowym 
urwiskiem. Nie ma absolutnie niczego, co mogłoby nas ochronić przed upadkiem, żadnych drzew czy krzewów. Przejście tego 
odcinka było dla mnie bardzo stresujące i nie zrobiłabym tego ponownie. Nie jestem przekonana, że ta wędrówka była tego 
warta. Możliwość przejścia za wodospadem jest ciekawa, ale poza tym uznaliśmy ten szlak za dość przeciętny. Nie polecam 
go w deszczowy dzień ani dla dzieci, osób z lękiem wysokości czy osób starszych. Poniższe zdjęcie zostało zrobione po 
trudnym odcinku – tutaj widać bardzo dobrą poręcz, której niestety brakowało na najbardziej eksponowanej części lewady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09014.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/IMG_20241030_110623047_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teraz przyszedł czas na relaks, a naszym pierwszym przystankiem było &lt;strong&gt;Madalena do Mar&lt;/strong&gt;, małe miasteczko znane ze słynnych plantacji 
bananów. Jest tam bardzo krótki szlak, RB3 Vereda da Vargem, zwany również Trasą Bananową, który pozwala zwiedzającym zagłębić 
się w świat uprawy bananów. Było naprawdę świetnie! To zdecydowanie doskonałe miejsce do odwiedzenia z dziećmi, a wcześniejsze 
zapoznanie się z cyklem wzrostu bananowców może pomóc w zrozumieniu tego, co tam możemy zauważyć podczas spaceru po plantacji 
bananów.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Można tam zobaczyć banany już owinięte niebieskimi foliowymi torbami, gotowe do zbioru. Banany są ścinane jeszcze zielone 
i dojrzewają poza drzewem. Z drugiej strony, można tam również zobaczyć malutkie banany dopiero zaczynające rosnąć oraz 
wiele kwiatów bananowca z delikatnymi, białymi pręcikami, które ostatecznie staną się bananami. Szczególnie spektakularne 
i piękne były kwiaty bananowców! Uważajcie, jeśli boicie się jaszczurek, z każdym naszym krokiem słyszeliśmy odgłosy wielu
uciekających okazów. Były trudne do zauważenia, ponieważ poruszały się bardzo szybko pod opadniętymi liśćmi bananowców, ale kiedy chodziliśmy powoli i w ciszy, 
udało nam się wypatrzyć kilka wygrzewających się w słońcu okazów.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09041.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09039.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zazwyczaj potrzeba od 9 do 12 miesięcy, aby roślina bananowa wytworzyła kwiat. Po jego pojawieniu się dojrzewanie bananów 
trwa od 3 do 6 miesięcy. Kwiaty żeńskie, znajdujące się na szczycie łodygi bananowca, przekształcają się w banany, tworząc 
„kiść”. Każda kiść składa się z kilku „rąk” (grup bananów), a każda ręka zawiera od 10 do 20 pojedynczych bananów (często 
nazywanych „palcami”). Pełna kiść na drzewie bananowym na Maderze składa się zazwyczaj z 5 do 10 rąk, co oznacza, że jeden 
kwiat może wydać od 50 do 150 bananów. Po wytworzeniu jednej kiści roślina obumiera, a z jej podstawy wyrasta nowa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09031.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09042.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W przeciwieństwie do większych bananów Cavendish, dostępnych w supermarketach, banany z Madery (banana da Madeira) są 
mniejsze, słodsze i mają bardziej intensywny smak. Dla nas miały inną konsystencję, bardziej przypominającą budyń i 
mniej skrobiową. Są uprawiane głównie przez małych rolników i zbierane ręcznie. Większość bananów maderskich jest spożywana 
lokalnie lub eksportowana na kontynent do Portugalii, my mieliśmy już okazję spróbować ich w Lizbonie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_122824_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_121541_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09043.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teraz przyszedł czas na odwiedzenie kilku punktów widokowych. Naszym pierwszym przystankiem było &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Massapez&lt;/strong&gt;, 
jedyne miejsce, gdzie byliśmy zupełnie sami, otoczeni kwitnącymi roślinami aloesu. Widok był spektakularny, a samo miejsce 
bardzo ciche, z zadaszoną strefą do siedzenia i dużym kamiennym grillem, jeśli ktoś chciałby przynieść własny węgiel i 
jedzenie. Musieliśmy zboczyć trochę z trasy, by tu dotrzeć, ale parking był przestronny i bardzo podobał nam się ten postój! 
Wiele osób opisuje to miejsce jako doskonałe do podziwiania zachodu słońca, więc może wieczorami jest tam bardziej tłoczno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09048.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09051_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolejnym punktem był &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Fio&lt;/strong&gt;, przy którym znajdowała się przytulnie wyglądająca restauracja. Może zdawać się, 
że linia brzegowa wygląda bardzo podobnie jak ta, którą podziwialiśmy z poprzedniego punktu widokowego, ale tym razem góry 
wpadały bezpośrednio do oceanu. Nie było tu żadnych miast ani dróg widocznych u podnóża klifów, tylko czysta natura. Z tego miejsca 
można dostrzec latarnię morską po prawej stronie, czyli najbardziej wysunięty na zachód punkt Madery, Ponta do Pargo, do 
którego następnie ruszyliśmy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09062.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachodnia Madera wydaje się być mniej oblegana przez turystów, ponieważ było to kolejne miejsce z bardzo małą liczbą 
odwiedzających. Dotarliśmy do &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro Farol da Ponta do Pargo&lt;/strong&gt;, gdzie latarnia morska stoi na wysokości 300 metrów. 
Przeszliśmy się wokół niej, podziwiając dramatyczny widok z klifu. Można zejść trochę niżej po zboczu, ale trzeba uważać, nie ma 
tu żadnych zabezpieczeń, więc nie warto podchodzić zbyt blisko krawędzi. Nie weszliśmy do muzeum, ponieważ było już zamknięte. 
Nie ma tu również ławek, a po deszczu teren na pewno staje się bardzo błotnisty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09074.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09068.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeśli chodzi o punkty widokowe, &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro da Boa Morte&lt;/strong&gt; był zdecydowanie jednym z najlepszych. Połączenie błękitnego 
oceanu, soczystej zieleni i spacerujących krów sprawiało, że wyglądał niezwykle malowniczo. Widok z parkingu i ścieżki 
prowadzącej do punktu widokowego był dość nietypowy. Ze specjalnej platformy można było spojrzeć w dół i podziwiać fale 
rozbijające się o skały. Gdy tam byliśmy, kilku turystów jadło swoje kanapki, co przyciągnęło ogromną liczbę jaszczurek, 
które otoczyły ich ze wszystkich stron. Jedna nawet próbowała wspiąć się na moją nogę, gdy podeszłam za blisko! To miejsce 
miało w sobie coś magicznego, piękna roślinność, zapierające dech w piersiach widoki na wybrzeże, ciszę i brak tłumów. 
Dla mnie widok na ścieżkę prowadzącą z parkingu na punkt widokowy był tym, co zapadło mi w pamięci najbardziej z tego miejsca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_144924_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09075.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09085.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widać stąd wybrzeże prowadzące do &lt;strong&gt;Fajã da Quebrada Nova&lt;/strong&gt;, gdzie można dotrzeć kolejką linową z Achadas da Cruz. Początkowo planowaliśmy z niej 
skorzystać (Miradouro do Teleférico das Achadas da Cruz) i zwiedzić okolicę, ale po stresującym przejściu przez eksponowane 
odcinki Levada Nova straciliśmy na to ochotę i tym razem postanowiliśmy odpuścić. Ten płaski kawałek żyznego lądu, zbudowany 
przez spływająca ławę u podnóża klifu, wykorzystywany jest do uprawy. Kolejka jest często zamykana przy silnych wiatrach.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09084.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W drodze do naszego ostatniego przystanku tego dnia zatrzymaliśmy się na lunch w małym barze w pobliżu Achadas da Cruz, a 
także po drodze kupiliśmy kilka wypieków w jednej z wiosek wzdłuż głównej drogi (więcej szczegółów w sekcji praktycznej 
tego wpisu). Aby nacieszyć się ładnym widokiem na Porto Moniz przed wjazdem do miasta, warto zatrzymać się na chwilę na &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro 
da Santinha&lt;/strong&gt;, punkt ten znajduje się tuż przy drodze i zdecydowanie warto zrobić tu szybki postój. Po przyjeździe do Porto 
Moniz zauważyliśmy, że wiele parkingów było w trakcie budowy. Z tego powodu zaparkowaliśmy trochę dalej, około 100 metrów 
od głównych parkingów. Parking ten znaleźliśmy w aplikacji Organic Maps, z której zawsze korzystamy, i bez problemu tam 
trafiliśmy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09088.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Najpierw przeszliśmy obok &lt;strong&gt;Porto Moniz Natural Swimming Pools&lt;/strong&gt;, gdzie obowiązuje opłata za wstęp. Było tu mniej ludzi, niż 
się spodziewaliśmy, ale zapewne wynikało to z późnych godzin popołudniowych oraz faktu, że słońce już skryło się za górami. 
Baseny wyglądały niesamowicie, zwłaszcza w połączeniu z falami rozbijającymi się o pobliskie skały, ale postanowiliśmy 
pójść dalej, do innego, bardziej naturalnego miejsca, gdzie nie trzeba płacić za wstęp. Naturalne baseny, uformowane w 
lawie tuż na krawędzi oceanu, prezentowały się bardzo interesująco. Jednak posiadanie butów do pływania byłoby dobrym 
pomysłem, ponieważ skały były dość ostre. Nie było tu tłumów i tylko kilka osób nadal pływało. To, co najbardziej przykuło 
naszą uwagę, to miejsca, w których woda była całkowicie spokojna, tworząc przejrzyste, nieruchome baseny tuż obok dzikich 
fal oceanu, które uderzały o skały, tworząc barierę chroniącą pływaczy od siły oceanu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09099.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09102.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09103.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ostatecznie postanowiliśmy wrócić i wejść do pierwotnie mijanych basenów. Jeśli nie po to, aby popływać, to przynajmniej 
po to, aby podejść bliżej rozbijających się fal i zobaczyć miasto z innej perspektywy. Jednak woda okazała się dla mnie 
zdecydowanie za zimna, udało mi się zanurzyć tylko do pasa, więc tym razem bez pływania! Gdyby pogoda była bardziej 
słoneczna, z pewnością moglibyśmy w pełni cieszyć się tym miejscem, ale niestety dotarliśmy tam zbyt późno (około 17:00) 
i słońce już skryło się za górami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09093.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09174_01_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09180.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po godzinie jazdy wróciliśmy do Funchal, gotowi aby jak najwięcej odpocząć przed jutrzejszym zwiedzaniem doliny Zakonnic 
(Curral das Freiras).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informacje praktyczne:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/pt/atividades-de-natureza/percursos-pedestres-recomendados/percursos-pedestres-recomendados.html&quot;&gt;Oficjalna strona internetowa&lt;/a&gt; do sprawdzania, czy szlaki turystyczne są otwarte po pożarach, które miały miejsce 
na wyspie latem 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilety na płatne szlaki można kupić online &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;na tej stronie.&lt;/a&gt;
Od 1 stycznia 2025 r. osoby niebędące rezydentami wyspy będą musiały zapłacić za wędrówki po ponad 30 trasach zarządzanych 
przez Instytut Lasów i Ochrony Przyrody (ICNF) na Maderze. Będą to w zasadzie wszystkie szlaki oznaczone jako PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Początek szlaku – kościół Igreja da Lombada w Ponta do Sol, gdzie zaparkowaliśmy samochód. Przeszliśmy zarówno Levada do 
Moinho, jak i Levada Nova, tworząc pętlę o długości 9 km. Nie znalazłam dokładnego opisu takiej trasy na oficjalnej stronie
turystyki Madery, byl tam jedynie opisany &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/pt/o-que-fazer/exploradores-da-natureza/atividades/trail-running/lombada-da-ponta-do-sol/&quot;&gt;bieg Ponta do Sol - Levada Nova&lt;/a&gt; co oczywiście wydaje mi sie szalonym pomysłem
żeby jeszcze biegać po tej wąskiej lewadzie i mijać się z innymi turystami.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/Screenshot 2025-01-26 204438_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Podczas naszych podróży zawsze korzystamy z aplikacji &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation&lt;/a&gt;, 
która okazała się bardzo dokładna na Maderze, nie zgubiliśmy się ani razu. Tym razem nawet spotkaliśmy grupę Polaków, 
którzy nie wiedzieli, czy są na właściwej lewadzie, bo oni robili tę samą pętlę, tylko w przeciwnym kierunku. Oznaczenie 
lewad widzieliśmy dosłownie tylko przy parkingu, potem ścieżki nie były już oznaczone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RB3 Vereda da Vargem, zwana „bananową trasą”, to bardzo krótki szlak, idealny na spacer z małymi dziećmi.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09044.JPG&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restaurant - 101 Bar. Bardzo przyjazny właściciel. Smakowała nam kanapka z wołowiną, ale drugie danie (jakiegoś rodzaju 
gulasz mięsny) było rozczarowujące, musiałam zostawić połowę mięsa, ponieważ było twarde i sprawiało wrażenie bardzo niskiej jakości.
Bardzo tanio, choć ceny nie były nigdzie podane. Za dwa dania główne i napoje zapłaciliśmy mniej niż 16 euro.

  &lt;li&gt;Piekarnia – Padaria Rodripan, Bardzo mała piekarnia znajdująca się w czyimś domu. Bardzo smaczne i tanie wypieki, kilka 
rodzajów ciastek oraz chleba, w tym miękki, lekko słodki chleb, który kupiliśmy na wędrówkę następnego dnia. Zdecydowanie 
polecamy, choć trzeba się spodziewać bardzo podstawowej strefy do siedzenia, z prostymi plastikowymi krzesłami.

  &lt;li&gt;Parking w Porto Moniz - darmowy parking na trawie, choć trochę ukryty. Około 5 minut spacerem od naturalnych basenów. 
Nie mamy pewności, jak długo pozostanie bezpłatny, ponieważ wszystkie inne parkingi były już płatne. Widzieliśmy też dużą 
tablicę informacyjną przy placu budowy nowego parkingu, bliżej basenów. &lt;br /&gt;

Bardzo ładne baseny, ale woda była lodowata! Słońce zachodzi tu wcześniej z powodu gór, więc przyjechaliśmy za późno, by w pełni cieszyć się słońcem, i nie zostaliśmy długo.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Madeira Adventure: Day 3 - Exploring the Beauty of the Wild West Coast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every evening, we made plans for the next day based on the weather and how tired we felt that day. The idea was to avoid 
having the most intense hiking days one after another. The weather looked more stable the next day, so we decided to hike 
up Pico Grande later. Today would be a less demanding day with a 9 km hike and a longer drive along the 
west coast, stopping at many viewpoints along the way. Our final stop was in Porto Moniz, where the famous natural pools 
are located. Everything took us longer than we planned, so I had to drive back to Funchal after sunset. However, the road 
via the inland (VE4) route is really good, traffic was low, and the drive was very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our hike with &lt;strong&gt;Levada do Moinho&lt;/strong&gt;, which was very easy and well-maintained. After taking a look at the river and 
having a break next to it, we started climbing the stairs to reach &lt;strong&gt;Levada Nova&lt;/strong&gt;, which had been above us the whole time. 
In this area, we also noticed signs of last summer’s wildfires and new ferns growing through the ash of the burnt forest, 
bringing life back to this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08973.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08958.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC08997.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09002.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, the path was very easy, leading to spectacular waterfalls, not necessarily because of their height or size, but 
because you can walk behind them. A waterproof jacket is highly recommended as both levadas have some more wet parts with
water dripping above the head. Afterward, there was also a fairly long 
tunnel on the way, but the light from a cellphone was enough to walk through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tunnel, the view opened up to a huge gorge behind, and for me, that was the scariest part of all the hikes during 
our entire stay on Madeira. I don’t remember the last time I was paralyzed by fear like this—probably when I was rock 
climbing in France years ago. I don’t have a strong fear of heights; flying isn’t my favorite thing, and I found paragliding 
stressful, but I still enjoy hiking in high mountains and tackling technical rocky sections, unlike my husband. However, 
this time, I really couldn’t force myself to take another step at one point, right after passing the waterfalls, where the 
beautiful views of the gorge began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was the missing railing. At least half of the trail has no handrail, and the path itself is just a 30 cm-wide 
concrete levada that ends with a vertical drop. There is absolutely nothing to protect you—not even trees—so it caused me 
a lot of stress to finish this section. I would not do it again. I’m not really convinced the walk was worth it. The 
passage behind the waterfall is cool, but other than that, we found this hike quite mediocre. I would not recommend it on 
a rainy day, nor for children or elderly people. Photo below was taken after the problematic section, here you can see
very nice railing that was unfortunately not covering the whole exposed part of leveda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09014.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/IMG_20241030_110623047_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time to relax, and our first stop was &lt;strong&gt;Madalena do Mar&lt;/strong&gt;, a tiny town known for its famous banana plantations. 
There is a very short trail, RB3 Vereda da Vargem, also called the Banana Route, which allows visitors to immerse themselves 
in the world of banana cultivation. It was really cool to explore! It’s definitely a great place to visit with kids, and it 
might be helpful to read a little about banana plants and their growth stages beforehand to understand what you’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see bananas already covered with blue plastic bags, ready to be harvested. Bananas are cut while still green 
and left to ripen off the tree. On the other hand, you can also see tiny bananas just starting to grow and many banana 
flowers with delicate white pistils that will eventually become bananas. I found banana flowers especially spectacular and
beautiful! Make sure you’re not scared of lizards because we could hear many of them running away with each step we took. 
It was difficult to see them since they moved so fast, but when we tried walking slowly and staying very quiet, we managed 
to spot a few resting in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09041.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09039.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It typically takes 9 to 12 months for a banana plant to produce a flower. After the flower appears, it takes 3 to 6 months 
for the bananas to develop and ripen. The female flowers at the top of the banana stem develop into bananas, forming a 
“bunch”. Each bunch consists of multiple “hands” (clusters of bananas), and each hand contains 10 to 20 individual 
bananas (often called “fingers”). A full bunch from a banana tree in Madeira typically consists of 5 to 10 hands, meaning 
one flower can yield around 50 to 150 bananas on average. After producing only one bunch, the banana plant dies, and a new plant 
grows from its base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09031.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09042.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the larger Cavendish bananas found in supermarkets, Madeira bananas (banana da Madeira) are smaller, sweeter, and 
have a more intense flavor. For us, these bananas had a different texture, more like pudding and felt less starchy. They 
are mostly grown by small farmers and harvested by hand. Most Madeira bananas are consumed locally or exported to mainland 
Portugal, we had already tried them in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_122824_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_121541_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09043.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time to stop by a few viewpoints. Our first stop was &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Massapez&lt;/strong&gt;, the only viewpoint where we were 
completely alone, surrounded by flowering aloe vera plants. It offered a stunning view and was a very quiet place, with 
a sheltered seating area and a huge stone barbecue if you wish to bring your own coal and food. We had to take a short 
detour to get here, but the parking area was spacious, and we really enjoyed the stop! Many people describe this place as 
an excellent sunset-watching spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09048.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09051_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miradouro do Fio&lt;/strong&gt;, with its cozy-looking restaurant, was our next stop. The coastline might look similar to what we had 
admired from the last viewpoint, but this time, the mountains going directly into the ocean. There was no city or road 
below, just pure nature. From here, you can see the nearby lighthouse on the right, Madeira’s westernmost point at Ponta do 
Pargo, so let’s go there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09062.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like Madeira’s west coast is less touristy because this was another place with very few visitors. We explored 
&lt;strong&gt;Miradouro Farol da Ponta do Pargo&lt;/strong&gt;, where the lighthouse stands 300 meters high, by walking around it and checking out 
the dramatic view from the cliff. You can go down a bit, but be careful, there is no security, so do not get too close to 
the cliff edge. We didn’t go inside the museum because it was already closed. There are no benches to sit on, and after 
a rainy day, this area will get very muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09074.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09068.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to viewpoints, &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro da Boa Morte&lt;/strong&gt; was definitely one of the best. The combination of the blue ocean, 
deep green vegetation, and cows walking around made it look very special. The view from the parking spot and the path leading 
to the viewpoint was quite unusual. From the viewing platform, you can look straight down and admire waves crashing against 
the rocks.
When we were there, some tourists were having a lunch break with lots of snacks, which attracted a huge number of lizards 
that surrounded them. One even tried to climb my leg when I got too close! There is something magical about this place, the 
beautiful greenery, the breathtaking coastal view, the peace and quiet, and the lack of crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_144924_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09075.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09085.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, you can see the coastline towards Achadas da Cruz, which you can reach by cable car. Initially, we wanted to 
take this cable car (Miradouro do Teleférico das Achadas da Cruz) and explore the area, but after the stress of the exposed 
parts of Levada Nova, we lost our enthusiasm for it and decided to skip it this time. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09084.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to our last stop for the day, we had lunch at a small bar near Achadas da Cruz and also stopped to grab some 
pastries in one of the villages along the main road (more details in the practical section of this post). 
To get a nice view of Porto Moniz before entering the town, it is worth stopping for a moment at &lt;strong&gt;Miradouro da Santinha&lt;/strong&gt;, 
which is right by the road, definitely a quick stop worth making. When we arrived in Porto Moniz, we noticed that quite 
a few parking areas were under construction. Because of this, we parked a bit further away, about 100 meters from the 
main parking lots. Fortunately, it was marked on the Organic Maps app that we always use, so we had no trouble finding it
(address at the end of the post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09088.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we passed by the Porto Moniz Natural Swimming Pools, where you need to pay for entrance. There were fewer people 
than we expected, but that was likely due to the late afternoon hours and the fact that the sun had already disappeared 
behind the mountains. The pools looked really cool, especially with the waves crashing against the rocks nearby, but we 
decided to walk further to another more natural spot with no admission fee. These natural pools, formed within lava rock 
directly at the edge of the ocean, looked very interesting. However, having 
swimming shoes would have been a good idea, as the rocks felt quite sharp. The area wasn’t crowded, and a few people were 
still swimming. What really caught our attention were the spots where the water was completely calm, forming clear, still 
pools right next to the wild ocean waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09099.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09102.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09103.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we decided to go back and enter the first swimming pool, if not to swim, at least to get closer to the crashing 
waves and see the town from a different perspective. The water, however, turned out to be way too cold for my liking, and 
I only managed to immerse myself up to my waist, so no swimming for me this time! If the weather had been sunnier, I think 
we could have really enjoyed this place, but unfortunately, we arrived too late (around 5 PM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09093.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09174_01_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/DSC09180.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of driving, we were back in Funchal, ready to hit the bed before exploring Curral das Freiras valley next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/pt/atividades-de-natureza/percursos-pedestres-recomendados/percursos-pedestres-recomendados.html&quot;&gt;Official website&lt;/a&gt; 
to check if hiking trails are open after the wildfires that occurred during the summer last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tickets for paid hiking trails can be bought online &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;on this website.&lt;/a&gt;
From January 1, 2025, non-residents will need to pay to hike on over 30 routes managed by the Institute of Forests and 
Nature Conservation (ICNF) in Madeira. These are basically all hikes marked as PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting point for the hike mas church Igreja da Lombada in Ponta do Sol where we parked our car. We did both Levada do 
Moinho and Levada Nova as loop of 9km.

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During our travels, we always use &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation app&lt;/a&gt;, which was very accurate 
on Madeira, we didn’t get lost even once.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RB3 Vereda da Vargem called Banana route, very short, perfect for a walk with small kids.

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restaurant  - 101 Bar. Very friendly owner. We liked the beef sandwich, but the second dish was disappointing (some kind of meat stew), I had to 
leave half of the meat as it was tough and felt like very low quality. Very cheap, but no prices listed anywhere. We paid 
less than 20 euros for both of us, including two mains and beverages.
Address: ER101, Sitio da Igreja, ER101 39, 9270-013 Achadas da Cruz, Portugal
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_154900_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bakery - Padaria Rodripan, A very small bakery located in someone’s house. Very tasty and cheap, offering a few different 
types of pastries as well as bread, including a soft, sweet one that we bought for our hike the next day. Highly recommended, 
but expect a very basic seating area with simple plastic chairs.                                                      &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Porto Moniza parking, free parking on a lawn, but a bit hidden. 5-minute walk from the swimming pools, though I’m not 
sure how long it will remain free since all other parking areas were now paid. We also noticed a large information board 
near the construction site of a new parking lot closer to the swimming pools.
Address: R. da Escola Velha 32, 9270-095 Porto Moniz, Portugal
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day3/20241030_170310_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portomoniz.pt/pt/&quot;&gt;Natural Swimming Pools&lt;/a&gt; – €3 entry fee. Nice swimming pools, but the water was very cold! 
The sunset happens early due to the mountains, so we arrived too late to fully enjoy the sun and didn’t stay long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Przygoda na Maderze: Dzień 2 – od spaceru nad oceanem po marsjański krajobraz, dwie twarze wyspy.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pl/podroze/2025/02/Dzien-1/&quot;&gt;Pierwszy dzień&lt;/a&gt; był już intensywny, ale na drugi zaplanowaliśmy jeszcze więcej: dwie 
zupełnie różne wędrówki, najpierw odkrywanie surowych krajobrazów półwyspu św. Wawrzyńca, a następnie nadmorski szlak Vereda 
do Larano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dostaliśmy radę od wypożyczalni samochodów, by wyjeżdżać z Funchal dobrze przed 8:00 rano, jeśli chcemy uniknąć porannych 
korków. Była to trafna wskazówka, rano rodzice odwożą dzieci do szkół w centrum Funchal, co w połączeniu z dojazdami do 
pracy powoduje duży ruch. Po niespełna 50 minutach jazdy dotarliśmy na pusty parking São Lourenço około 8:10, ale gdy skończyliśmy 
wędrówkę o 11:00, samochody były zaparkowane wzdłuż drogi aż do kolejnego dużego parkingu przy hotelu Resort Spa &amp;amp; Marina, 
nawet 1,5 km od początku szlaku. Zawsze staraliśmy się zaczynać najpopularniejsze trasy jak najwcześniej, by uniknąć tłumów 
i problemów z parkowaniem. Tego dnia nie tylko łatwo znaleźliśmy miejsce, ale też liczba osób mijanych w drodze powrotnej 
była znacznie większa. Zaczynaliśmy wędrówkę niemal samotnie, a kończyliśmy w towarzystwie długiej kolejki ludzi idących 
w przeciwnym kierunku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Część osób przyjeżdża tu specjalnie na wschód słońca. Kiedy my dopiero zaczynaliśmy, kilka osób już schodziło ze szlaku. 
Nie jestem fanką wstawania o świcie, zwłaszcza po tym, jak w Nepalu wspięliśmy się na Poon Hill w ciemności, by zobaczyć 
wschód słońca. Byłam wtedy zmarznięta, zaspana i nie potrafiłam się zachwycać widokami. Dlatego teraz raczej odpuszczamy 
takie doświadczenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08772.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Półwysep &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ponta de São Lourenço&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, zwany też półwyspem św. Wawrzyńca (patrona żeglarzy) albo też „Smoczym Ogonem” ze względu na kształt (szczególnie widoczny z lotu ptaka), to 
miejsce naprawdę niezwykłe. Poranne słońce rozświetlało wszystko ciepłym światłem, a ocean był niemal całkowicie spokojny. 
Szczególnie podobały nam się czerwone, bogate w żelazo skały wulkaniczne (bazalt) i surowy krajobraz, niemal pozbawiony 
roślinności. Kontrast między czerwonymi, czarnymi i żółtawymi skałami a lazurowym oceanem tworzył widok jak z innego świata.
W trakcie wędrówki mogliśmy obserwować łodzie dopiero co wpływające do pobliskich zatok i sieci rybackie rozstawiane przez lokalnych 
rybaków, ten obszar słynie z bogatej fauny morskiej. Cisza o tej porze dnia była wspaniała i w pełni pozwalała rozkoszować 
się pokonywanymi kilometrami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08778.JPG&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08790.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dobre buty to absolutna podstawa. Ścieżka jest kamienista, zwłaszcza w końcowym odcinku, który staje się stromy i trudniejszy. 
Po minięciu kawiarni czeka nas podejście z linami pomocniczymi, ale wiele z nich było zardzewiałych lub zerwanych, a część 
ścieżki w bardzo złym stanie. Wystające, ostre fragmenty mogły łatwo skaleczyć dłonie. W takich warunkach wspomniana kawiarnia 
wyglądała jak mała, zielona oaza, otoczona palmami, z widokiem na ocean. Idealne miejsce na kawę i chwilę odpoczynku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na końcu szlaku znajduje się punkt widokowy, jednak barierka zabezpieczająca była uszkodzona. Widzieliśmy osoby wychodzące 
poza nią w pogoni za „lepszym ujęciem”, zachowanie skrajnie nieodpowiedzialne, biorąc pod uwagę strome urwiska. Jedynym 
minusem tak wczesnej pory była trudność w zobaczeniu końcówki półwyspu (czyli „Smoczego Ogona”), ponieważ ostre światło 
słoneczne świeciło prosto w oczy. Będąc tam po południu, ta część szlaku powinna wyglądać dużo lepiej, ale wtedy
nie będzie szans na wędrówkę w ciszy i spokoju.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08828.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08829.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08841.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na Maderze pojawiliśmy się w tym samym tygodniu, w którym rząd wprowadził opłaty (od 28 października 2024 r.) za dostęp 
do najbardziej malowniczych szlaków, w tym również tego. Kupiliśmy bilety online, ale na miejscu był też starszy pan z 
papierowymi biletami, przygotowujący się do pracy. Po naszej wędrówce, na parkingu ustawiła się już kolejka osób kupujących bilety 
gotówką, a dwóch młodszych strażników sprawdzało je przy wejściu. Mam nadzieję, że wpływy z opłat rzeczywiście zostaną przeznaczone 
na renowację i bezpieczeństwo szlaków, bo stan trasy był zły, uszkodzone kładki lub brakujące zabezpieczenia. Według 
oświadczenia rządu, wszystkie dochody mają trafić na utrzymanie tras, ich sprzątanie i ochronę przyrody. W dobie gwałtownego 
wzrostu liczby turystów, ta zmiana wydaje się konieczna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liczba osób mijanych w drodze powrotnej była ogromna, największa podczas całego naszego pobytu (na zdjęciu poniżej widać 
sznurek ludzi widziany z daleka w początkowej części szlaku). Dobrze, że wybraliśmy się 
tam z samego rana. Gdybyśmy zaczęli później, nasza przygoda nie byłaby aż tak przyjemna. W wąskich miejscach tworzyły się 
wręcz zatory, a przeciskanie się do punktów widokowych skutecznie odbierało magię miejsca. Początkowa cisza i pustka szlaku 
były niesamowite! W drodze powrotnej wręcz przyspieszyliśmy kroku, by jak najszybciej stamtąd odjechać.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08845_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_104400_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miradouro da Ponta do Rosto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; był naszym kolejnym przystankiem, znajduje się zaledwie kilkaset metrów od drogi prowadzącej 
od szlaku PR8. Stamtąd mogliśmy zobaczyć fragment trasy, którą właśnie przeszliśmy, z zupełnie innej perspektywy. Dramatyczne 
klify i kolorowe formacje skalne wyglądały przepięknie. Ponta de São Lourenço to jedno z tych miejsc na Maderze, które po 
prostu trzeba zobaczyć. Oferuje zupełnie inne doświadczenie niż zielone szlaki lewad. Ta wędrówka, z niesamowitymi widokami, 
bardzo mi się podobała! Najbardziej wysunięty na wschód punkt Madery wygląda wręcz nierealnie i powinien znaleźć się na 
liście każdego, kto odwiedza wyspę. Cieszyłam się, że nie przybyliśmy zbyt późno, mogliśmy od razu ruszyć dalej, na dłuższy 
nadmorski szlak do Porto da Cruz.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08855.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po krótkiej jeździe samochodem i minięciu miasta Caniçal, zaparkowaliśmy przy drodze ER109, niedaleko starego tunelu, gdzie 
rozpoczęliśmy wędrówkę szlakiem Levada do Caniçal. Skorzystaliśmy z aplikacji Organic Maps, ponieważ przy drodze nie zauważyliśmy 
żadnych oznaczeń trasy. Na początku ścieżka prowadziła obok wielu domów, mijaliśmy drzewa granatów oraz hortensje, które 
w cieniu wciąż zachwycały kolorami (podczas gdy te przy drogach już dawno przekwitły). Od samego początku szliśmy wzdłuż 
niewielkiej lewady. Gdy dotarliśmy do lokalnej drogi asfaltowej, trzeba było wypatrywać ostrego zakrętu w lewo, na szczęście 
był oznaczony kamieniem, wskazującym kierunek na Vereda da Boca do Risco. Pierwsze kilka kilometrów prowadziło w pobliżu pól 
uprawnych, lokalni mieszkańcy doglądali swoich warzyw i roślin. Później ścieżka weszła w las, gdzie spotkaliśmy biegające 
kozy, a my mogliśmy odpocząć w cieniu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_121957.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_122550_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08862.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_122633_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Las stawał się coraz gęstszy, a szlak coraz bardziej stromy i kamienisty. Po drodze minęliśmy zaledwie kilka osób i jednego 
biegacza, zanim dotarliśmy na szczyt. Wtedy naszym oczom ukazał się widok na ocean i wkroczyliśmy na Vereda do Larano. 
Krajobraz zmienił się diametralnie. Ocean wyglądał w tym miejscu spektakularnie! Głęboki, intensywnie niebieski kolor 
wody wspaniale kontrastował z soczystą zielenią wzgórz. Po chwili ścieżka zaczęła prowadzić przez strome zbocze porośnięte
niskimi, pokręconymi drzewami, które osłaniały nas od wiatru i sprawiały, że strome urwiska po bokach nie wydawały się tak 
przerażające. Co jakiś czas można było dostrzec w dole wysokie fale rozbijające się o skały i wodę kotująca się miedzy nimi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_130057_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08884.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08882.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta część szlaku była nieco bardziej uczęszczana, ale wciąż na tyle spokojna, że mogliśmy w pełni cieszyć się wędrówką. 
Minęliśmy może kilkadziesiąt osób, więc w porównaniu z tłumami na Półwyspie św. Wawrzyńca, było tu niemal pusto.
W najbardziej wyeksponowanych fragmentach zbocza zamontowano barierki z metalowych lin, co dawało poczucie bezpieczeństwa. 
Zaczął wiać dość silny wiatr, ale zapierające dech w piersiach widoki na klify przez większą część trasy wynagradzały każdy trud.
Skały przy ścieżce były porośnięte licznymi sukulentami. Jesteśmy przyzwyczajeni do oglądania ich w doniczkach lub ogrodach botanicznych, 
dlatego widok ich naturalnie rosnących na niemal pionowych, surowych skałach był niezwykły. To piękny przykład 
adaptacji przyrody do ekstremalnych warunków. W pewnym momencie, w oddali, dostrzegliśmy nawet majestatyczny półwysep 
Ponta de São Lourenço, który odwiedziliśmy wcześniej tego samego dnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08913.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08894.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po minięciu zardzewiałej kolejki linowej w pobliżu Porto da Cruz, przez chwilę szliśmy asfaltową drogą, przy której 
zaparkowanych było wiele samochodów, większość turystów rozpoczyna wędrówkę właśnie tutaj i wraca tą samą trasą (wariant 
„tam i z powrotem”). Następnie skręciliśmy na ścieżkę prowadzącą przez pola i wzgórze, skąd roztaczał się widok na miasteczko 
(w aplikacji Organic Maps była oznaczona jako jedyna przerywana linia w pobliżu wybrzeża). Można też kontynuować trasę 
wzdłuż drogi, ale jest to opcja dłuższa i mniej bezpieczna. W końcu dotarliśmy do plaży z czarnym piaskiem i kamieniami, 
a następnie podążaliśmy wzdłuż wybrzeża aż do centrum miasta. Na zdjęciu poniżej widać Penha de Águia, dominującą nad 
Porto da Cruz formację wulkaniczną, która wznosi się niemal 600 metrów nad poziom morza!
To była bardzo różnorodna trasa — zaczynająca się od polnych ścieżek, prowadząca przez leśne odcinki, aż po spektakularny 
spacer wzdłuż klifów. Szlak był stosunkowo łatwy, choć w kilku miejscach wąski i dość eksponowany. Dla osób z silnym lękiem 
wysokości może to być wyzwanie, ale zamontowane barierki z lin znacznie ułatwiały przejście najbardziej wymagających fragmentów.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08928.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_151649.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Po tak intensywnym dniu nadszedł czas na porządny posiłek, a zaraz po nim, powrót do auta. Ponieważ dostępny był tylko 
jeden kierowca Bolta, bardziej opłacało się wziąć zwykłą taksówkę z powrotem na parking. Mimo nieco wyższego kosztu byliśmy 
bardzo zadowoleni z tej decyzji, dzięki temu mogliśmy przejść całą trasę bez konieczności zawracania i pokonywania tego 
samego odcinka dwa razy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ponieważ zostało nam jeszcze trochę czasu, postanowiliśmy zakończyć dzień na &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miradouro do Pico do Facho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, oddalonym o nieco 
ponad kilometr od miejsca, w którym zostawiliśmy samochód. Z punktu widokowego roztacza się panorama na Międzynarodowe 
Lotnisko Cristiano Ronaldo. Rano byłam w szoku, gdy uświadomiłam sobie, że w pewnym momencie jechaliśmy… pod pasem startowym! Lotnisko 
na Maderze ma unikalne przedłużenie pasa startowego, wsparte na ogromnych betonowych filarach, co umożliwia przejazd samochodów 
pod spodem. Ta rozbudowa została zaprojektowana, by pomieścić większe samoloty i zwiększyć bezpieczeństwo. Pierwotny pas 
był dość krótki i lądowanie uchodziło za jedno z trudniejszych w Europie. Droga biegnąca pod pasem startowym to część 
autostrady VR1, co czyni tę przejażdżkę naprawdę wyjątkowym doświadczeniem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miradouro do Pico do Facho to spokojne miejsce, idealne na chwilę odpoczynku. Wokół rosną ogromne kaktusy, a na miejscu 
dostępne są toalety i mały bar z przekąskami, choć był już zamknięty, gdy dotarliśmy tam po godzinie 17:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08943.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08947.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Następnego dnia ruszyliśmy na zachodnie wybrzeże Madery, by odwiedzić naturalne baseny w Porto Moniz oraz mnóstwo punktów 
widokowych, zostańcie z nami!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informacje praktyczne:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/pt/atividades-de-natureza/percursos-pedestres-recomendados/percursos-pedestres-recomendados.html&quot;&gt;Oficjalna strona internetowa&lt;/a&gt; do sprawdzania, czy szlaki turystyczne są otwarte po pożarach, które miały miejsce 
na wyspie latem 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilety na płatne szlaki można kupić online &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;na tej stronie.&lt;/a&gt;
Od 1 stycznia 2025 r. osoby niebędące rezydentami wyspy będą musiały zapłacić za wędrówki po ponad 30 trasach zarządzanych 
przez Instytut Lasów i Ochrony Przyrody (ICNF) na Maderze. Będą to w zasadzie wszystkie szlaki oznaczone jako PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ponta de São Lourenço ‘Półwysep św. Wawrzyńca’ – 7.5 km, 2h30min. &lt;br /&gt;
Ten szlak już wcześniej miał opłatę w wysokości 1 euro, zanim wprowadzono najnowsze zmiany. Patrząc na naszą trasę i oficjalną 
mapę, zastanawiam się, czy ostatnia część za barem jest w ogóle oficjalnym szlakiem, może dlatego nie była odpowiednio 
utrzymana. Jednak nie było tam żadnego znaku ani informacji, że nie powinniśmy dalej kontynuować… no chyba że nie zauważyliśmy. 
Po prostu podążaliśmy dobrze widoczną ścieżką do końca, celowo pomijając restaurację, ponieważ nie mieliśmy czasu na dodatkową 
przerwę.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/en/what-to-do/nature-seekers/activities/hiking/pr-8-vereda-da-ponta-de-sao-lourenco/&quot;&gt;PR8&lt;/a&gt; oraz &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/media/bnpngpg0/pr8-vereda-da-ponta-de-sao-lourenc-o.jpg&quot;&gt;szczegóły trasy&lt;/a&gt; można znaleźć na oficjalnej stronie internetowej.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_081142_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Można tu również dotrzeć autobusem 113 z Funchal, rozkład jazdy poniżej (zdjęcie z przystanku autobusowego na parkingu São Lourenço). 
Ogólnie szlak jest dobrze utrzymany na głównej trasie, ale początkowy odcinek jest w złym stanie, brakuje wielu drewnianych 
desek lub są uszkodzone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08851.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro da Ponta do Rosto, mały parking, ale ludzie przyjeżdżają i odjeżdżają szybko, więc znalezienie miejsca na 
krótką, 10-minutową przerwę zazwyczaj nie stanowi problemu.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Levada do Caniçal - Vereda da Boca do Risco - Vereda do Larano - Porto da Cruz – 13.44km, 3h30min. &lt;br /&gt;
Taksówka powrotna do auta – 18 euro, 11 km jazdy (jedyny dostępny samochód w aplikacji &lt;a href=&quot;https://bolt.eu/en/support/articles/115003024753/&quot;&gt;Bolt app&lt;/a&gt; był droższy – 24 euro).
Samochód zostawiliśmy dokładnie tutaj: P6MP+44 Machico, Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/Screenshot 2025-01-26 204224_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08873.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Podczas naszych podróży zawsze korzystamy z aplikacji &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation&lt;/a&gt;, która 
okazała się bardzo dokładna na Maderze, nie zgubiliśmy się ani razu. Podczas pierwszej wędrówki dnia nie musieliśmy jej 
nawet używać, ale szlak przybrzeżny był bardziej skomplikowany (szczególnie na początku), ponieważ poruszaliśmy się fragmentami 
różnych tras. Zauważyliśmy tylko jeden dobrze oznakowany drewniany słupek na skrzyżowaniu, między Vereda da Boca do Risco a 
Vereda do Larano (pierwszy punkt widokowy na ocean).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restaurant A Pipa - restauracja i bar z bardzo dużymi porcjami (moja ryba, i frytki mogłyby być podzielone na 
dwie osoby), smacznym jedzeniem i czystymi toaletami. Niewiele ponad 20 euro za osobę, wliczając napoje.
Adres: Casas proximas, 9225-050 Porto da Cruz, Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Madeira Adventure: Day 2 – coastal hike and walking on the surface of another planet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2025/02/Day-1/&quot;&gt;The first day&lt;/a&gt; was already intense, but for the second, we planned even more: two 
dramatically different hikes—the rugged, barren landscapes of The Dragon’s Tail and the lush, coastal beauty of Vereda 
do Larano. The first one offered a feeling of being on another planet, especially with the rising sun that made the 
colors of the landscape truly spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were advised to leave Funchal before 8:00 AM to avoid traffic. Solid advice, as parents drop off their kids at schools 
in the center of Funchal, which in combination with people getting to their workplace gets really busy. We arrived 
at an empty São Lourenço parking lot around 8:10 AM, but by the time we finished the hike at 11:00 AM, 
cars were parked up to 1.5 km away from the start of the hike, reaching another big parking lot close to the Resort Spa &amp;amp; Marina hotel. 
We always made it a point to do the most famous hikes first thing in the morning to avoid crowds and parking issues. That day, not 
only was parking much easier, but the number of people we encountered on the way back was drastically higher. It was 
surreal to start the hike with almost no one around and then finish with a line of people going the opposite direction. When we started 
our hike, there were already a few people coming back, they had surely gone there to see the sunrise. We once hiked up &lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2018/07/AnnapurnaPoonHill/&quot;&gt;Poon Hill&lt;/a&gt;
in the dark and on an empty stomach to see the sunrise, but learned this isn’t for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08772.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ponta de São Lourenço peninsula is called the Dragon’s Tail because of its shape, especially when seen from above. 
The morning sun was amazing—the colors were warm, and the place was unbelievably quiet. That day, there was 
almost no wind, and the ocean looked very calm. We particularly liked the red-colored, iron-rich volcanic rock called 
basalt and the stark landscape devoid of vegetation, which made this place look surreal. The contrast between the red, 
black, and yellowish rocks and the blue ocean in this area makes the landscape even more unique. During the hike, we also 
observed boats coming to the nearby bays and fishing nets used by local fishermen. This area is known for its rich marine 
biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08778.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08784.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08792.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08790.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good shoes are definitely a must, as the path is rocky, especially toward the end, where it becomes more demanding. After 
passing the café, the last stretch climbs steeply uphill, with wires to hold onto. However, many of these wires were rusty 
and therefore dangerous, and large sections of the path was broken and in poor condition. Additionally, the wire used 
to assist with the climb was broken or missing in many places, with some sections having fallen or frayed, leaving sharp 
bits sticking out that could easily cut your hands. The challenging trail conditions make the café you’ll encounter 
even more appealing, as it stands like a little green oasis surrounded by palm trees. Great stop for everyone that 
needs a coffee break or grab something sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08824.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08838_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end of the trail there is a viewpoint where the protective fence was damaged. We noticed several people 
stepping beyond it to the very edge to snap better pictures, which struck us as quite irresponsible given the steep drop. 
One downside of hiking so early during this time of year was that the peninsula’s tip—known as the “Dragon’s Tail”—was 
barely visible from this viewpoint due to the sharp sunlight shining directly into our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08828.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08829.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08841.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Madeira the same week that the government started applying fees (October 28, 2024) to the most stunning 
trails, including this one. We bought our tickets online, but when we arrived shortly after 8 AM, there was an older 
man with paper tickets getting ready for the day. After our hike, a small queue had formed with people trying to buy 
tickets with cash, and two additional younger park rangers were checking them. I hope this money will be used to renovate 
the trails and make them safer, as this one was in bad shape, with broken wooden boards in several places. According to 
the government’s statement, all profits from the new tourist fee will go toward trail maintenance, cleaning, and preservation 
efforts. With Madeira experiencing a rise in tourism, this change was really necessary. The number of people we passed on 
the way back to the car was remarkable—the highest during our whole stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08845_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_104400_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miradouro da Ponta do Rosto was our next stop since it is located just a couple hundred meters from the road leaving 
the PR8 hike. It gave us a great overview of the part of the hike we just did, from another angle. We could see 
dramatic cliffs with colorful volcanic rock formations. Ponta de São Lourenço is one of Madeira’s must-visit 
hikes, offering a completely different experience from the island’s lush levada trails. I really enjoyed this walk with 
truly mind-blowing scenery! This easternmost point of Madeira Island is just unreal and a must-see for everyone visiting. 
I was very happy that we didn’t arrive too late and could quickly move on to our next goal for the day: a longer coastal 
hike to Porto da Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08855.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short car ride and passing Caniçal, we parked on the ER109 road near the old tunnel, where we started with Levada 
do Caniçal. We were following Organic Maps because we hadn’t seen any trail signs next to the road. First, the path 
passed many houses, and we admired pomegranate trees and hydrangeas that still had nice colors if growing in the shade. 
From the very beginning, we followed a small levada. Once we reached the local road, we had to look for a sharp turn to 
the left, which was luckily marked on a stone pointing to Vereda da Boca do Risco. The first few kilometers led close to 
fields where local people grow their crops and vegetables. Next, the path entered the forest, where we saw goats running 
around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_122633_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest became denser, the path steeper and rockier. We passed only a few people and a trail runner before reaching 
the top. When the ocean view opened, and we reached Vereda do Larano, the landscape changed dramatically. We were now 
walking along a steep slope, but luckily, small trees growing there created a feeling of protection. This part of the hike 
was definitely more crowded but not to the point that it would negatively affect our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_130057_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08882.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most exposed parts, there was a wire fence. It got quite windy, but we could admire stunning cliffs for most of the 
hike, so it was definitely worth exploring this area. Also, the rocks next to the trail were covered with numerous succulents. 
We mostly know these from garden centers, so seeing them thrive on the rugged, nearly vertical rocks beside us was 
unexpected—a beautiful reminder of nature’s resilience. At one point, we 
even noticed majestic Ponta de São Lourenço peninsula far in a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing the rusty-looking cable car near Porto da Cruz, we followed the road for a moment where many cars were parked 
as most people start their hike here and return to the same place (out and back variant of the hike). Next, we turned onto a path leading through 
fields and a nearby hill to admire the view of the city (marked as the only dashed line near the coast in Organic maps app). 
It’s also possible to just walk along the road, but it is longer 
and less safe. Finally, we reached the black sand and pebble beach and followed the coastline until the city center. Below, 
you can see in the photo Penha de Águia towering over the city. This volcanic rock formation clearly dominates the landscape, 
standing at almost 600m in height! It was a very diverse hike, starting with dirt paths, forested sections, and finally reaching 
a dramatic cliffside walk. It was relatively easy but had some narrow and exposed areas—not for those really afraid of 
heights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08928.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_151649.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time for a proper meal after this exhausting day. Since there was only one available Bolt driver, taking a 
normal taxi back to our car was now the cheaper option. We were happy with this decision despite the extra cost because it 
allowed us to complete a longer hike without repeating any part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we still had some time, we decided to finish the day at Miradouro do Pico do Facho, just a little over 1 km from 
our car, where we could admire the view of Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. I was shocked in the morning when I 
realized that, at one point, we were driving underneath the airport runway! Madeira Airport has a unique elevated runway 
extension, supported by large concrete pillars, allowing vehicles to pass 
underneath. This extension was built to accommodate larger planes and improve safety, as the original runway was quite 
short and challenging for landings. The road that passes beneath is part of the VR1 highway, making it a really cool 
experience for drivers. Miradouro do Pico do Facho was a peaceful spot to sit and relax, surrounded by large cactuses. 
There were also restrooms and a small snack bar, though it was closing when we arrived after 5 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/DSC08947.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll explore Madeira’s West Coast and natural pools in Porto Moniz so stayed tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ifcn.madeira.gov.pt/pt/atividades-de-natureza/percursos-pedestres-recomendados/percursos-pedestres-recomendados.html&quot;&gt;Official website&lt;/a&gt; 
to check if hiking trails are open after the wildfires that occurred during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tickets for paid hiking trails can be bought online &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt/services/78-82-259&quot;&gt;on this website.&lt;/a&gt;
From January 1, 2025, non-residents will need to pay to hike on over 30 routes managed by the Institute of Forests and 
Nature Conservation (ICNF) in Madeira. These are basically all hikes marked as PR.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ponta de São Lourenço ‘The Dragon’s Tail’ – 7.5 km, 2h30min. This hike already had an entrance fee of 1 euro before the 
most recent changes. Looking at our hike and the official map now, I wonder if the last part after the bar is even an 
official trail—maybe that’s why it was not properly maintained. However, there was no sign or information indicating that 
we shouldn’t continue, at least none that we noticed. We just followed a well-visible path to the end, deliberately skipping 
the restaurant since we didn’t have time for an extra break.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmadeira.com/media/bnpngpg0/pr8-vereda-da-ponta-de-sao-lourenc-o.jpg&quot;&gt;a detailed summary of the hike&lt;/a&gt; can be
found on official websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Portugal/Madeira/Day2/20241029_081142_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to get here by 113 bus from Funchal, see schedule below (photo from the bus stop at São Lourenço parking).
Overall, the path is well maintained in the main section but not at the beginning, where many wooden boards are missing 
or broken, and not after passing the café (still questionable whether this is part of the official hike).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miradouro da Ponta do Rosto - small parking area, but people come and go quickly, so finding a spot for a short 10-minute 
stop is usually not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Levada do Caniçal - Vereda da Boca do Risco - Vereda do Larano - Porto da Cruz – 13.44km, 3h30min
Taxi back to the car 18euro, 11km ride (only one available car on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bolt.eu/en/support/articles/115003024753/&quot;&gt;Bolt app&lt;/a&gt; 
but more expensive, 24euro). We left the car at: P6MP+44 Machico, Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During our travels, we always use &lt;a href=&quot;https://organicmaps.app/&quot;&gt;Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails, and Navigation app&lt;/a&gt;,, which was very accurate 
on Madeira—we didn’t get lost even once. We didn’t even need to use the app during the first hike of the day, but the 
coastal hike was more complicated since we were hiking on parts of different trails. We noticed only one proper wooden 
post when we reached the crossing between Vereda da Boca do Risco and Vereda do Larano (the first viewpoint with an ocean 
view).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restaurant A Pipa - restaurant &amp;amp; bar with big portions, clean, and tasty food. About 20 euro per person including drinks.
Address: Casas proximas, 9225-050 Porto da Cruz, Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
