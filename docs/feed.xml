        <title>Another destination from Lecco, Monte Coltignone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After hiking to &lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2019/09/Monte-Resegone/&quot;&gt;Monte Resegone&lt;/a&gt;, a day trip around the Como lake by 
ferry, it was finally time for another hike, this time to Monte Coltignone. It was supposed to be 
tough and it certainly was. Three kilometers and 1000m altitude gain, this can’t be good :) 
First we took a bus to Laorca (more details in the section practical info) where we started the hike. 
You can reach the peak by two trails: one passing Medale and one, easier but longer route, which is 
also the most popular. We don’t like to walk the same way up and down the peak and obviously I wanted to 
scramble a bit more and that was guaranteed by choosing the first option, Santiero G.E.R trail (number 59).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06621.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Lecco, for me the city itself was not particularly special but the surrounding mountains added a lot 
of beauty to this place. Como has its beautiful cathedral, Varenna its castle with a spectacular view, 
Bellagio its expensive shops and Lecco has spectacular mountains but you need to put in more effort (and 
get more sweaty :p) to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06623.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/IMG_105527361.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06831.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole way up was really steep! Except the first couple hundreds meters when we passed a few houses before entering the forest. As we made our way up the mountain, the path didn’t get flatter even for a moment and our calves were still really sore after the previous hike. So we were walking slowly but steady to finally reach the wooden sign indicating route number 57 to Monte San Martino and route nr 59 to Monte Coltignone (Santiero G.E.R). We took a short break there, looking at the peak Corno Medale, which was really close to us (we think there is no touristic path to this peak). Now we were on more exposed terrain, with rocks to climb, chains to hold. At one point we passed a tiny cavern with a Madonna statue, right before the most difficult part of the hike :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06833.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06836.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06838.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06841.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it being a very nice, sunny day, the visibility was not great. We couldn’t clearly see the lake and distant peaks. When we reached the top of the mountain we were quite surprised to see a big forest on the other side, after this whole steep part. So basically you have a nice view but only on one side of the mountain, the one we have chosen to get to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06845.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06850.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06847.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06851.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monte Coltignone looks totally different from the other side which can be reached by wide, easy path from the shelter S.E.L Rocca-Locatelli in Piani Resinelli (you can park your car there). Between the peak and the shelter we could admired a stunning peaks of Grigna massif in a distance (first photo below). On the way back we passed Casa Museo di Villa Gerosa, Rifugio S.E.L Rocca-Locatelli in Piani Resinelli which was unfortunatley closed. Next, we followed the stream Torrente Calolden where the path got steeper and really rocky until we finally reached Laorca village again. The path we took to go down from Monte Coltignone was much easier, of course steep and exhausting but not dangerous (no exposed terrain or chains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06854.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/DSC06862.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final sprint to catch the next bus and we were back on our way to Lecco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came to Lecco from Como S.Giovanni by train (4.80 euro per person) which was the main means of transportation used by us to travel between the cities in Italy. It’s easy to find a schedule on the websites, usually we bought our ticket in the ticket machines, at the counter at the train station (Trenitalia) or in the newspaper shops (Trenord). The shops have a sticker from Trenord in the shop window if they sell them. You can’t buy them in the machines from Trenitalia. Check both links &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.trenord.it/site-lite/index.html&quot;&gt;Trenord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html&quot;&gt;Trenitalia&lt;/a&gt;. In Lecco you can buy a 12 rides bus ticket for 13 euro (single ride is 2 euro) and use it for more then one person at the same time (just need to validate it more times). The ticket is valid for 90min and within this time you can make changes so it’s pretty good deal. Schedule of the buses you can find here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lineelecco.it/tpl/orari-invernali/&quot;&gt;Busses in Lecco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the hike in Laorca where we got by bus number 7 (bus number 1 also goes there, we used on the way back bacause unfortunately the connections are really infrequent so better check it before). The bus stop was called Laorca Asilo on &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.me/&quot;&gt;MAPS.ME&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to track our position to press STOP button on the bus in the right moment. It worked really well and when we got out there, first we followed the street Via Giuseppe Baruffaldi (on the corner of this street was a bus stop in the oposite direction) until we reached the church, then Via alla Grigna until the parking where we found an information board, pointing to the begining of the path to Monte Coltignone. See the whole hike on the map below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/MonteColtignone/Screenshot 21-46-31.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Coltignone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also very nice and easy hike to Monte Barro. One evening I did a run on the slopes of the mountain. The view of the lake and the city was really nice and should be even better from the peak. After you cross the bridge, Ponte Azzone Visconti, just walk to the other side of the street and there will be a tiny street a little bit to the left, Via San Michele, with the sign indicated the time needed to reach the peak (around 2h). Very nice for running because the rocks are not loosy so I felt pretty comfortable running there. There is also running/cycling path along the lake which I checked on the way back (see the map below).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A day hike to Monte Resegone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lecco, a small city located on the southern tip of Lake Como turned out to be a fantastic base for hiking lovers. 
We could have actually stayed here longer than we did as we still had plenty of ideas for day hikes or just regular 
sightseeing. More about the city itself in the next post :) Our host in Lecco knew a lot about the mountains 
surrounding this region and suggested us two of the most demanding hikes and we enthousiastically followed her 
ideas :D The weather predictions were really good so we decided not to wait long and do the most demanding hike to 
Monte Resegone (1875m) the next day. It was not the distance which made this hike challenging but the altitude 
gain of around 1500m. We started the hike from the place where we stayed in Lecco (Acquate district) and we made 
our way up to hiking path number 1 which we followed to rifugio Luigi Azzoni near the peak of Monte Resegone. This 
path starts at the bottom of the cable car in Versasio and it first leads through the forest on a nice, wide,rocky 
path. Then it passes a small group of houses (Frazione Costa) and a shelter Rifugio Antonio Stoppani. From there we 
could already admire the stunning view of Como lake and Lecco city. The path was clearly marked with red-white-yellow stripes with number one written in the middle. Marks were placed on the rocks or trees, so no worries to get lost (of course you need to pay attendion on the crossings with other paths e.g. with MTB trails or paths leading to via ferratas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06629.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was eager to reach the higher parts of the trail, above the tree-line and enjoy the impressive rock formations. I got super excited when I saw the first chains, that meant the path was about to get more interesting! :D In many places it was necessary to use hands, it was more like a scrambling than normal hike but these parts I just loved. Not everyone would be so excited (including my boyfriend) but I was climbing for 7 years so that part of me will always love the feeling of rocks and being in the exposed terrain. We had amazing weather but be aware that this path is difficult and many accidents happens there when it’s icy or rainy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06646.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06663.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06682.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06677.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06692.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06699.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view from the peak was really cool, mountains all around, when clouds moved out of the way we could see distant peaks and of course Como lake which, all together, create a spectacular experience! We stood there for a while admiring the mountain peaks. With over 30 peaks on the horizon, I found it really useful to look at the metal plate with points to all off them indicating their names and heights. There is a shelter next to the peak so you can grab some snacks, sandwich or even a simple hot meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/IMG_121345847.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-45&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to try another hiking path and go back to Piani d’Erna by trail number 10 (passing a few peaks, Punta Stoppani, Manzoni &amp;amp; Dente) which is less popular and unfortunately had way more loose rocks which actually makes it quite difficult to walk down as there was a high probability of falling down. Our muscles were constantly tense and got really tired after the first difficult part with some chains and falling rocks. Also, it got very foggy, the visibility was really low as shown on the photos below. If you really don’t like to do twice the same path then I would recommend to go up to the peak by the route number 10 and go down with number 1 which is still difficult but has less loosy rocks which are especially annoying while going down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/IMG_134055691.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06705.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/IMG_134052323.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/DSC06703.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are afraid that this is gonna be too much for you but you still want to enjoy the spectacular views, then taking cable car to Piani d’Erna is a good idea. It will shorten the hike meaningfully, then it’s “only” about 550m of altitude gain to Monte Resegone. On the map below you can see our hike and the distance. It took us almost 4h to get there and almost the same (including breaks) to get back. We were not rushing, just enjoying the day. As always, navigation app MAPS.ME was very useful to double check our position and to find a shortcut to our room in Lecco. You can just simply download maps of the region where you stay for an offline use (maps of more than 100 countries in the world ready to download!). It worked even in Marocco when we did 10 days hike in Atlas Mountains where the paths were not really marked and difficult to find. We hightly reccomend this app for hiking but also for sightseeing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/maps-me-offline-map-nav/id510623322&quot;&gt;MAPS.ME app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/Screenshot 21-47-52.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path was clearly marked with red-white-yellow colors and number one written in the middle. No worries to get lost, just look carefully for the marks on the rocks or trees. It is a popular destination for Italians and we met many of them on the hiking trail (or maybe it was crowded because it was Saturday). We did the hike in our trail running shoes (Salomon Speedcross 4 and Salomon SENSE RIDE) but high-cut hiking boots would be definitely recommended here. We are used to hike with lighter types of shoes and it works for us. Use gear you are comfortable with, this is not the place for experimentation ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Italy/Monte_Resegone/IMG_090851298.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Monte Resegone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many activities happening in Lecco that weekend, besides the climate change meeting, there was an obstacle run which took place the day we went to Monte Resegone. On the way back we saw the participants struggeling to cross a big wall and climbing an obstacle with many ropes. We participated a few times in obstacle runs in Germany and Belgium and we highly recommend this kind of activity as a great adventure :) Check this link &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scigamatt.com/site/index.php/&quot;&gt;Scigamatt in Lecco&lt;/a&gt; in case you want to try something unusual during your next holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A trip to Little Switzerland</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Visiting Berdorf in Luxemburg? Why not! We couldn’t miss our chance to finally check one of the options for a weekend trip when you live in Belgium. The initial idea was to do the whole Mullerthal trail route 2 which is around 37km. However, life is unpredictable and we had to modify our plans a little bit. Since we left Leuven on Saturday morning and arrived to Berdorf (the starting point of a trek) at 10.30 am there was not enough time to do the complete route so on the way we decided to skip one loop and took a shortcut to the next village. The first part (around 6km) from Berdorf to Mullerthal led along big rocky walls, the further we got from the car parking, the quieter it got with less and less hikers on the way. The large, high rocks situated close to each other started to create narrow passages, darker and colder inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05267.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;The part from Berdorf to Mullerthal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05277.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; alt=&quot;The part from Berdorf to Mullerthal&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05278.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-50&quot; alt=&quot;Narrow passage between big rocks&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mullerthal village offers a camping site, some places to buy drinks and fast food. We passed the village quite fast, constantly following wooden poles with the name of the route (and distance to the next village). After some time we saw Schiessentümpel Cascade, famous waterfalls atracting many tourists but I need to admit, after having seen waterfalls in Iceland and Laos, they are rather small ;) The shape and style of the wooden bridge above made a bigger impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05295.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;The part from Berdorf to Mullerthal2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit further, close to the viewpoint Burgkapp, we had a chance to shorten our hike and go straight ahead to the village Consdorf, skipping the loop to the south and cutting off a few km. We passed Burgkapp, La Pineda camping site, Consdorf (there is a bakery close to the church) to finally reach Scheidgen where we picked up Mullerthal trail route 2 again. The part from here to Echternach was a bit borring. Beautiful, old forest but less groups of rocks which you can explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05317.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Berdorf viewpoint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05316.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-45&quot; alt=&quot;Berdorf viewpoint&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view of village Echternach where we had a dinner and ice cream :) Visiting this touristic place required us to walk down a steep path to the village and come back the same way what means steep uphill parts as well but it was worth it. On the photo below you can clearly see St. Willibrord Basilica, which dominates the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05325.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Village Echternal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we explored the area nearby our camping in Berdorf. Amazing viewpoints where you can admire the hills sourrounding the area are a great spot for many tourists to relax. Numerous narrow passages between the rocks attract children with head lights, exploring them without any fear. We really got lost amongst narrow corridors, it feels like being in a labyrinth! Good shoes are highly recommended since the rocks and steps can be quite slippery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05378.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Berdorf viewpoint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05389.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Berdorf viewpoint&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05396.JPG&quot; class=&quot;column-45&quot; alt=&quot;Narrow passage between big rocks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area has a lot to offer not only for hikers, runners or cyclists but also for sport climbers! Around 1km from the camping Martbusch you can find this little but very interesting area with sandstone rock. Most of the climbing routes are rated between 5 and 6. The beautiful forest surrounding this spot makes it colder, something every climber appreciates during the hot summer :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05414.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Climbing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mullerthal trail route 2 - 31km, we skipped around 7km part in south, taking a shortcut from Consdorfer Millen parking to Scheidgen where we again started to follow Mullerthal trail 2 until Berdorf, see the map below for details&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/Map from runkeeper 2019-08-06.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the Camping Belle-Vue 2000 (around 8euro/person, steel fire bowl and portion of wood - 12 euro) in Berdorf. There are many camping sites in the area of Mullerthal trail route 2 so it is definitely possible to split the whole track into a few parts and explore the area a bit more. There are really plenty of places to check, beautiful rock formations, view points and caves which are difficult to really explore if you do the whole trek in one day like we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Luxembourg/DSC05353.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Village Echternal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lao New Year's Celebrations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pi Mai Lao, celebration of the New Year in Laos during the hottest part of the year was an 
unexpected event we gladly joined  :D Officially it is a 3-day celebration but in some cities 
like Vientian or Luang Prabang it can last over a week. During the New Year celebrations the entrance 
to all temples is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day we decided to visit Pha That Luang, a large gold-covered stupa; a national monument and the 
symbol of Vientian. We again used the public transportation to get to this part of the city (bus nr 
10 from the crossing near the central bus station, we found the correct bus stop based on the map 
with information on the central bus station).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03309.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Buddhist temple nearby the stupa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03284.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enormous statue of reclining Buddha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Large gold-covered stupa, the symbol of Vientian&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of each temple, Buddha statues are placed in easy accessible places so devotes can pour 
scented water with flower petals over the statues. It symbolizes washing last-year’s sins away since 
the first day of celebrations is the last day of the old year. Everyone wants to enter the New Year 
without any sins. Then, they collect the water which runs over the Buddha and take it home to pour over 
other members of the family as a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03298.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;In the front of the main entrance the table with many small Buddha statues is prepared for devotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03306.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Everyone was dressed in a very special way, floral shirts for men and beautiful long dresses for women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03324.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;As you can see, the jade Buddha statues wear various robes for different seasons of the year (covering the statue at the different levels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03204.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;On every street you could buy offerings for this special days composed of banana leaves and flowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03196.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;According to the tradition people buy gift baskets with food or cosmetics for the elderly members of their families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03326.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Some people sell birds in the bamboo cages, intended to be set them free as a symbol of a prosperity and good luck (we have seen a banners trying to discourage tourists from taking part in it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03316.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Beautiful, long dresses are a very important aspect of the celebrations :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/DSC03329.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Since it was the hottest part of the year, people were pouring the whole buckets of water on each other, perfect way to cool down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already around a lunchtime people started to pour water on each other and few hours later all the streets 
turned to a giant battle field. Pickup trucks, full of people and buckets of water were appearing more 
and more often on the street so it was a time to switch from a normal camera to our waterproof GoPro :) 
We noticed in front of most houses inflatable swimming pools to cool down and owners waiting with hoses, 
water pistols and buckets to pour water over the pedestrians. No one could stay dry that day :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/GOPR8182.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The owners of our guesthouse prepared delicious food, beers, lao-lao (Laotian rice whisky), loud music and a lot of water to make sure no-one who passed by  remained dry :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/GOPR8206.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Along the promenade there were few stages where we could listen a Laotian music, dance in a foam or underneath the sprinklers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/NewYear/GOPR8233.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Laotian techno party which turned into Laotian pop concert a bit later. Probably some well-known group since everyone was singing along with the band :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day of the celebrations is a day to relax, the one between the last day of an old year 
and the first day of a New Year (third day of the celebrations). We noticed that the owners of the 
guesthouse where we stayed were “very tired” in the morning :D We took the bus to Vang Vieng, this wasn’t 
easy since only one company was operating during a holiday (the price was also somewhat higher than normal).
It was difficult to stay dry during the next days, there were always many kids along the road, waiting 
to pour water on passers. Better get a good waterproof bag* for all your documents, electronics and money! 
You can buy them actually on the every corner of the street. Walking from the bus station to our 
guesthouse,  which was about one kilometer, was a very tricky task as we didn’t want to get wet. We had 
to basically look around each corner of the street and check if it was safe to go there. Being in a tuk-tuk 
was not helpful either, since whenever the tuk-tuks with tourists stopped, there were some kids with water 
running towards them to get everyone inside soaking wet :O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, to survive the Laotian new Year celebration, get a waterproof bag, and feel again like a 
child and enjoy pouring water on the others! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Pha That Luang (bus number 10) - 4k per person, one way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Vang Vieng (minivan) - 60k Kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a waterproof bag ! It wil come in handy quite often if you are there in the wet season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Buddha Park in Vientian</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Buddha Park, located 26km from the city center, was our main destination for that day. We decided to use 
the public transportation to get there and it turned out to be an easy and cheap solution.  First you need 
to go to the central bus station which is divided into two parts: CBS1 and CBS2. You can easily find an 
information boards about bus routes and prices with the description in English. It was necessary to get 
bus number 14 from the CBS2 part of the bus station and after around 40 min of a bus ride we arrived to 
Buddha Park. All tourists on the bus were going there and the women selling tickets on the bus very loudly 
shouted the name of the stop and took care that all tourists are out :D The bus also passes the immigration 
office next to the Friendship Bridge on the border with Thailand. Our visit in Buddha Park took around 
1,5 hour and we caught the bus back on the other side of the street where we got off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buddha Park is a sculpture park with more than 200 religious statues made of concrete. A huge dome-shaped 
sculpture consist of three levels: the lowest showing hell, then middle one is an earth and heaven on the 
top with nice view over the whole park. Huge demon’s mouth are the entrance to this scary place. It is 
really narrow inside and probably always very crowded. For me it was bizarre place, especially after 
visiting hell :) The park was created by monk who studied both Buddhism and Hinduism. That’d why this place 
is full of Buddha images, Hindu gods, demons and animals common in both beliefs. You can easily buy there a 
snack or chill out in cafe nearby the Mekong river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/BuddhaPark/DSC03214.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enormous reclining Buddha (40 meters long) is one of the biggest attractions of the park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/BuddhaPark/DSC03228.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The way to the view terrace was through a dark hell :O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/BuddhaPark/DSC03249.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Panoramic view of the Buddha Park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nice lunch in the city center we walked to check Patuxai, a war monument, victory gate surrounded
by a nice green park with fountain. It is possible to walk to the top of the monument and admire the 
view of the city. That’s exactly what we did :) On the way to the top you can buy souvenirs and clothes 
from the local vendors. The monument inside is not well maintained, many bird nests destroyed the 
paintings on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/BuddhaPark/DSC03266.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Buddha Park - 6 000 Kip per person, one way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrance ticket to Buddha Park - 15 000 Kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrance to Patuxai - 3 000 Kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Vientian, capital with an endless number of temples</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First something about how we got here. In a nutshell, after a short boat ride from Don Det to Nakasong, 
we took a bus to Pakse where we were supposed to have a lunch break. Instead of this, the bus stopped 
on the side of the road and we had to change to another bus. Six of us ended up this way on a local bus 
without anyone speaking English. For the next 7h we were stuck on the bus without any breaks. During the 
bus ride a group of women entered the bus a few times with chicken, fish and meat skewers sold as a snack. 
We arrived to Thathek late in the evening and decided to buy immediately something to eat since we were 
really hungry after the whole day without almost any food (we were not brave enough to buy sth on the bus). 
Around the bus station were many hostels but it was already dark so we just wanted to find something 
closeby and go to sleep. Luckily after checking few options, we found a guesthouse with a clean room and a 
good price :) In the morning we took a VIP bus at 9:15 which was really comfortable! This time we had a few 
breaks to use a toilette and to buy some food. After 6.5 hour we arrived at Southern Bus Station in Vientian, 
12km from the city center. It was necessary again to take a tuk-tuk, drivers inside the bus station where asking 
60 000 Kip for the ride, we managed to knock the price down to 30 000 Kip negotiating with drivers waiting just 
outside the bus station. We decided to stay in Vientian next 3 days to celebrate the Lao New Year in the capital 
of the country :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vientian has a great variety of Buddhist temples and we spend the first day wandering around a downtown in 
search of our favourite one. There is no entrance fee to the most of them, with the exception of Phra Keo 
and Wat Sisaket. Interior of the first temple is now a small museum with Lao religious art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03165.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03172.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Phra Keo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one on the contrary was quite unique, characterized by walls full of tiny Buddha statues (thousands 
of them!). Along the wall surrounding the main temple, there was also a long line of seated big Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03187.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Wat Sisaket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03182.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Buddha gallery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed that almost all temples were decorated with snake like creatures which are called naga and are believed 
to protect the city and live in Mekong river. All temples were very clean and decorated with colorful bands and 
flags for upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;/en/travel/2018/11/Lao-New_Year/&quot;&gt;New Year celebrations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03261.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Naga guarding the entrance to the temple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Inside one of a temple. You are usually welcome to enter and have a look, though taking of your shoes 
is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03176.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;More gold statues of Buddha next to the temple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a late lunch and a break to cool down we headed off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://copelaos.org/&quot;&gt;COPE center&lt;/a&gt;. Laos, 
similar to Cambodia has his own dark period in the history which still has an influence on people’s lives. During 
9 years of the Vietnam War (1964 - 73), more than 270 million cluster bombs were dropped all over the country. 
Up to 30% of them did not detonated and many villages are still threatened with unexploded bombs. Despite the 
effort of  bomb clearance every year many people (around 100) dies and almost half of the victims are children. 
The bombs usually explode  when people are farming, cooking on fire or when children unawares of the danger 
play with small bomblets (which are about the size of a tennis ball) :( COPE offers rehabilitation and provides 
artificial limbs, walking aids and wheelchairs for victims. More importantly, it gives them a hope for a normal 
life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/DSC03191.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Sculpture made by using covering of the cluster bombs in front of COPE information center&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Each of the cluster bomb contains around 600 to 700 small bomblets...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/IMG_20180423_105414542_HDR.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The region of Nong Khiaw in the north of Laos is still in a great danger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/IMG_20180423_105431405_HDR.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It is recommended to not walk off the path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we explored the area of Mekong promenade. We noticed really nice looking place for a night market (apparently 
opened in 2018) with new, wooden stands, however half of the were empty and most of the vendors were still selling 
on the street. The night market stretched from the sunset view point to the Chao Anouvong statue. This area of the 
city was really crowded in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/IMG_20180412_191904124.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Night market glowing in a distance...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/Vientian/IMG_20180412_191659775.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Since the food on the market didn't have any English descriptions, we opted to play it safe and go 
to a local restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Thakhet (from Don Det) - 110 000 Kip / per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Vientian (from Thakhet) - 80 000 Kip / per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuk-tuk from the southern bus station to the center of Vientian - 30 000 Kip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrance fee to Wat Sisaket, Phrat Keo - 10 000 Kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Don Det, a gateway to Laos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Crossing the borders by land is always more complicated than by plane but we like challenges. Actually, the ride 
from Siem Reap to Don Det in Laos was smoother than we were expecting :) Maybe due to the right choice of bus 
company (&lt;a href=&quot;http://asiavantransfer.com/&quot;&gt;Asia Van Transfer&lt;/a&gt;) or just pure luck. Since the journey 
isn’t easy and requires a few changes from bus to van to boat, it was very useful when the employee of the 
company showed us a folder with pictures detailing how the transfer would go. The morning of our departure they 
explained us again in details the whole procedure so we felt quite confident. However the driver who took us 
to Stung Treng (first stop where we had a 1 hour break for a lunch) was driving in a very dangerous way, speeding 
70-90km/h through a villages full of people cycling and kids playing on the side of the road. That was the longest 
part of a journey, 5 hours by minivan. After a lunch (2-5$) another minivan drove us to the border where we had a 
chance to exchange American dollars to Lao kip (exchange rate 1$ = 8200 Lao kip, on Don Det it was 8100) and fill 
the entry card for the Lao visa. However, first we had to leave officially Cambodia what means getting a stamp for 
2$. Then we were free to walk with our luggage to arrivals of immigration office on Lao site where we all could get 
visas. Visa rates change depends on country of your origin, but there is a chart to see your country rate, for 
Polish citizens it is 30$, Sebastian (Belgian) had to pay few dollars more. On the top of that we paid an additional 
1$ (per person) because we were crossing the border during the weekend and 2$ (per person) for the “activation” of 
the visa. It is basically a state-condoned bribe, but they’ll hold onto your passports until you pay up. So arguing 
about those extra fees will just extend the whole procedure and the driver will not wait for someone who is late. 
After all got their visas we started the last drive to Nakasong where we had to change for a boat to Don Det (north 
pier). During less than 20 minutes boat ride we knew this gonna be an amazing place! And indeed, we stayed there 
longer than we planned :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mekong river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Big differences in the water 
level and many rapids create a perfect conditions for spectacular waterfalls and we were going to look for them. 
This region of Mekong delta consist of lots of tiny islands between each people travel by small boats. Most of 
them are uninhabited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no ATM on the island so be sure to have enough cash with you! It is also not necessary to book a room 
in advance since there were plenty of options to choose from. There are two main roads on Don Det, on the sunrise 
and sunset site of the island, where you can find a wide variety of bungalows. Get one with a balcony and a hammock, 
this island is just perfect to lay back, relax and do nothing :) We booked a (rather expensive in hindsight) hotel 
room for the first night and were welcomed by two cockroaches (which Sebastian had to deal with before I could 
sleep), as we decided to stay longer we got a bungalow on the sunrise side of the island. The advantage of the 
situation was that we could check the cleanliness, the condition of the mosquito net and the comfort of the 
hammock before taking the room :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We again decided to rent a bikes (10000 kip per bike) and explore the island where we stayed, Don Det and 
Don Khon. Both islands are connected by the historical French bridge with a beautiful view on Mekong Delta 
backwater. We started to cycle from the north pier of Don Det, following the dirt path on the sunrise site of 
the island. Then we crossed the bridge and again started to cycle along the east shore what is indicated on the 
map by increasing number of kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;As indicated on the map, we cycled around 20km on both Don Det and Don Khon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Getting closer to the bridge connecting two islands, Don Det and Don Khon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After around 8-9 km of cycling, already on Don Khon, we noticed sign pointing to the waterfalls and decided to 
check them. We left our bikes close to the restaurant, crossed an unstable wooden bridge and started to look for 
the best view on waterfalls. The waterfalls are a bit hidden so you need to carefully walk between high bushes 
(we turned left after crossing the bridge). There was also a box to donate some money for a maintenance of the 
bridge by locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/DonDet/DSC03033.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Wobbly bridge remained me of these from Nepal :O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/DonDet/DSC03029.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Small, hidden cascades...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our idea was to cycle further to the south of the island, however at one point we were forced to stop because the 
bridge collapsed. With no way to get across we had to backtrack a few kilometers and take another path. It was 
getting awfully hot already … perfect time for a lunch and a cold drink with a view over the Mekong Delta. We 
left the main attraction of the island, Li Phi Waterfalls for the afternoon. On the way there we noticed rusty 
locomotive, legacy of the time when there was a railway connecting both islands (7 km long). It was closed in the
middle of 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It is common to have a pig on a rope instead of a dog in front of a house. As you can see, 
they adapted to strong sun by darker color of the skin and hard soil by having a massive snout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The sunset view from our guesthouse, truly amazing! :D This region is well-known from the best 
sunsets in SE Asia. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Laos/DonDet/IMG_20180409_184526029.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Here I discovered the best beer in SE Asia :) Perfect to drink while admiring a sunset!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really like the character of this place and relaxed atmosphere so it was difficult to leave this place. We 
experienced many power cuts in the evenings, owners of the restaurants were ready for such a possibility and 
immediately put a candle on the table what made an atmosphere ever better :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was Vientian, the capital of Laos but how to ride almost 850km? :O If you want to make it in 
one go, be ready for a boat ride, 2h bus to Pakse, then night bus (12h) to Vientian. It didn’t sound appealing to 
my boyfriend who is tall and always has difficulty to be comfortable on the bus. In one of the offices we bought 
a bus ticket to Thakhek, where we decided to spend one night and split into two parts this long distance to Vientian. If you want to know about problems we encountered during the journey, check upcoming post :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrance fee to Li Phi/Tad Somphamit Waterfalls - 35000 kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renting a bike - 10000 kip per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bungalow - 40,000 Kip (5$)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Room in a guesthouse 13$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket to Thakhek - 70000 KIP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other possible activities we did not try:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kayaking tour - 170,000 KIP - 220,000 KIP depending on agent (half day)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tubing - 10,000 KIP&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both required attention since there are many places with the rapidly increasing current which turns into rapids!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Yummy! Cambodian cuisine a well-kept secret :)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had no clue what to expect about Cambodia cuisine. Is it actually different from Thai or Laotian cuisine? Before 
this trip we referred to virtually all dishes from this continent as Asian food :p After visiting a few countries 
we became aware these are vastly different countries, each has their own local culture and cuisine. While Thai and 
Vietnamese restaurants are common in Europe, the Khmer kitchen was a mystery… we have never seen any restaurant 
with Cambodian food on the menu. Why is that? I guess because not that many ethnic Cambodians are living abroad 
(the biggest group lives in France) where they could promote a culture and cuisine of their own country. Another 
problem is very high application fee for a Cambodian passport (100$ for a 10-year passport while in Vietnam the 
fee is only 15$) so not many people have it and travel abroad. Our tuk-tuk driver told us monthly salary for someone 
working in a hotel is between 70-120$ depending on the job. I can imagine it is extremely difficult to spend the 
whole month’s salary only on a passport, not to mention being able to afford plane-tickets, a visa, a hotel, … 
once you are abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both totally FELL IN LOVE with Cambodian cuisine and food-wise it is our number one country in Asia :D In this 
post I will try to introduce you to a few typical dishes. First a little bit about the most important meal of the 
day, breakfast. In Cambodia, a baguette is very popular since it was a French colony in a past. It was a basis of 
our breakfasts, combined with an omelette or a jam with a cup of strong coffee, sweetened with condensed milk or a 
fruit shake (mango, pineapple, papaya, all taste delicious) :) As a main meal usually rice with meat and a larger 
variety of stir-fried vegetables or curries. Another important ingredient is 
the famous Kampot pepper which is often used to make pepper sauce. Seafood was available everywhere, however I can’t 
tell anything about it because I don’t eat seafood :p A few times I had  fish and it was really delicious. 
Turmeric, galangal, ginger, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves are 
essential spices in Khmer cooking. As a dessert I had many times a pancake with mango or banana and sweet 
condensed milk, yummy! Most of the time we had to wait quite long for a food but we need to remember that 
all meals are freshly prepared, they are simple but very tasty! Food is also less spicy compared to 
Thailand (including red and green curry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180403_192051672.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Amok is a thick soup with pieces of fish (traditional version), chicken or beef, steamed in 
banana leaves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Lok Lak - stir fried slices of beef or chicken with garlic and oyster sauce served on 
lettuce with rice and Kampot pepper sauce (mix of lime juice and pepper)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180404_195225279.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chicken ginger - stir fried slices of chicken with chopped marinated ginger and onion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180329_115109104.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Mango sticky rice with coconut sauce as our special Easter meal :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180401_173055730.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Tapioca pudding with banana and sesame. Bananas which are available in Europe 
are not suited for cooking something like this ... I already found out the hard way !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were traveling only by bus, it is important to mention what you can get as a snack during a break. 
Fried banana chips, cut fruits, various meat from barbecue, rice in banana leaves, cold beverages and sweets like 
chips and cookies. Very often it was also possible to buy a warm meal, simple rice or noodle dishes e.g. fried 
rice with vegetables and egg was always a tasty and safe option :) During one bus ride a group of women entered 
the bus with chicken, fish and meat skewers but also with balut which other passengers seated behind us had  as a 
snack. Balut is a boiled egg with a developed duck (or chicken) embryo, which will likely turn some stomachs of 
Europeans and Americans not used to this :O However it is considered a delicacy by some, even so much that a few 
days ago&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/63-year-old-woman-fined-7000-for-attempting-to-smuggle-490-balut-duck-eggs&quot;&gt; a 63-year-old woman tried to take 490 balut eggs through customs on Singapore airport&lt;/a&gt;. 
Of course, she got caught and had to pay 7000S$ fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180411_120756088_HDR.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/Food/IMG_20180417_192700940.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Food from the bbq you can find on every market (seafood, meat) or even buy during the 
ride on a local bus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend all sorts of delicious fruit shakes! I know fresh fruits are considered somewhat risky 
to have one but I couldn’t resist the taste and how incredible all this fruits look on a street stalls! :) 
It is always good to have a walk and try to peek how they are made on each stall, if they cut fruits using 
gloves, use bottled water… it should be all right. Pineapples, mangoes, papaya, they all taste differently than 
in Europe. Look at the second row from the top (right photo), huge mangoes! They literally weight always at least 
0.5kg :O I got pretty addicted and had one almost every day :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Angkor Wat: the rise and fall of the Khmer Empire</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cover of National Geographic which I saw 10 years ago and the article inside caused me to 
dream about discovering the Khmer Empire. It felt so unreal back then and fortunately some dreams come true 
earlier than you would expect. There I was, standing in front of Angkor Enterprise in disbelief with a 3-day 
Angkor-Pass in my hands :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/GOPR8004.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Let the adventure begin! A big bottle of water in the bike basket was 
essential while visiting this archaeological park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Khmer Empire reigned over a huge area of South-East Asia; spanning from Myanmar in the west to Vietnam in 
the east between the IX and XV century. Angkor is the biggest known complex of buildings before the industrial 
revolution (the area of current-day Paris!). There are many theories why the empire collapsed at the end of 
XVI century. It could have happened due to domestic conflicts or incursion of armies from neighboring countries, 
though the more recent opinion from researchers is that changes in the local climate forced the population to other 
areas. They discovered an advanced system which helped people to collect and store water over the changing seasons. 
Due to severe drought, followed by intense flooding, the ancient Khmer population lost control of their water 
management and agriculture suffered significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day we cycled a 40 km loop (you’ll find this on the map under &lt;em&gt;grand circuit&lt;/em&gt;) on rather old, 
rusty bikes rented from our hotel. The area is very flat and distances between different temples are pleasant 
to do on a bike. You can enjoy the rural landscape and stop wherever you want, though the extreme heat makes 
cycling very intense (protection against the sun is very important!). Unfortunately, at one point my extremely 
old tire burst, and the tube exploded, … so we had to wait over 1.5 hour to get another bike from the hotel. 
Again, we experienced great hospitality in Cambodia, a waitress from the restaurant immediately offered me her 
personal cell-phone to call for help (It’s easier and way cheaper to make a local phone call). Next time we 
rented a bike, we always checked tires for cracks in the rubber (a sign they are old and worn, prone to blow-out)
more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;grand circuit&lt;/em&gt;, passes many amazing sites but note that the main attractions are part of the &lt;em&gt;petit circuit&lt;/em&gt; 
(the small circuit), which we did the second day. We entered the archaeological park through ticket check point 
(north from the ticket office) and started a grand tour counterclockwise. Our first stop was at the small Kravan 
Temple, then Banteay Kdei (walk to Srah Srang to see the beautiful lakeside), Pre Rup, East Mebon, Ta Som, Neak Pean,
Krol Ko (small but no one was there!) and finally Preah Khan (very big, interesting bridge leading to the 
entrance). On the way back we caught a glimpse of the world-famous temples: Bayon and Angkor Wat :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02385.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The women quickly ran towards us and proudly showed their shops offering a great deals, really great deals for clothes :) What I noticed, there was no unhealthy competition, the lady who run towards us with some clothes and reached us first, had a right to show us her shop. There was a lot of lough behind that scene :D How surprised was our tuk-tuk driver when after visiting one temple I came back in a new set of clothes :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02414.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Pre Rup, climbing the steep stairs to the top of this temple is rewarded with a panoramic view of the complex. Here we admired intense, warm shades or orange colour on the walls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02439.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Umbrellas were very often used for sun protection by many women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02384.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Figures seems to come out of the walls :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02504.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Gorgeous wooden path leading to Neak Pean, a temple located on the island in the middle of a pond. I really loved the surroundings, lush vegetation and pieces of trees sticking out of the water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02466.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since for the next day the plan was to see sunrise at Angkor Wat, we decided to rent a tuk-tuk with a driver. 
Cycling without lights at 5am did not feel safe enough. In the evening we cut a deal with one of a drivers on a 
street close to our hotel. He agreed to start at 4:30am and do with us the most famous temples in the whole 
complex: Angkor Wat, Bayon and Ta Prohm (so called small circuit) for 15$ what was the average price from what 
we found online… however, our driver did not show up next day! :O Either he overslept or someone offered him 
more money (apparently even 1 $ more from someone else could be the cause). We made a huge mistake by not 
taking a photo of his name and phone number, so we had no way to reach him :( It is usually indicated on 
the side of a tuk-tuk so remember about it. The guardian from our hotel called the hotel’s tuk-tuk driver 
but the price was considerable higher (28$) since he need to pay a fraction to the owner of the hotel. After a 
short negotiation he agreed to lower the price to 20$ and 10min later we started a crazy drive towards Angkor 
Wat to catch the sunrise! I was shocked to see so many tuk-tuks were headed in the same direction. I realized 
there was no chance for a quiet sunrise :/ After quick control of our tickets, we reached parking packed with 
hundreds of tuk-tuks. Now it was time to walk as fast as we could and take over as many people as possible :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02602.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Sun rises behind the Angkor Wat illuminating the temple. The weather conditions were not perfect that day but still the experience was unforgettable...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02578.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;....however we had to share it with hundreds of people :O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02635.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Main path leading to the Angkor Wat, already crowded ... and it was just 7am :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angkor Wat is the biggest temple in the whole archaeological park with five famous towers shaped like lotus buds. 
You can go to the top platform and admire the beautiful surroundings (there is a limit of people who can be there 
at once so long ques can occur). This temple is still actively being used, as indicated by the presence of monks 
and shrines in some spots a monk will pray for you if you give them small donation. We spent maybe 1.5 hour 
wandering inside multiple corridors before the big groups of tourists entered, their guide disturbing the peace 
inside with speakers to amplify his voice :-O I do need to admit that this complex looks better from the distance 
when great lotus-shaped towers reflected on the surface of the pond. Angkor Wat lacks some of the intricate 
decorations you can find in some of the smaller temples :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the photo below you can see one of the 5 gates which were leading to the ancient city of Angkor Thom where inside you can find a famous Bayon, one of our favorite spots! Unfortunately, nowadays it is surrounded by a big roundabout  so you can see and hear the traffic during your visit inside. The temples located a bit further from the roads had this natural atmosphere of isolation and mystery. It was already very crowded when we arrived there, especially on the top level. However, we found a quiet, narrow, mysterious corridors on the ground level. Away from the crowds we felt like true explorers :) Afterwards we walked through Baphuon, Phimeanakas to finally see The Elephant Terrace and the Terrace of the Leper King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lunch break it was a time for the final highlight of that day, Ta Prohm. Made famous by the (first) Tomb Raider movie with Hollywood star, Angelina Jolie playing the role of Lara Croft. This temple is really special as trees were not removed during the renovation so you get an impression how Angkor looked when discovered by the French naturalist Henri Mouhot in 1860. Of course, a lot of work was done to prepare this place for tourists so that everyone can visit this place safely. We just loved this temple so much that decided to come back next day at the opening hour (7:30) to see this place without the crowd (we found a tuk tuk driver in the morning). Haha, it turned out that only during the first 30 minutes you can explore this place with only a small group of tourists because at 8am the first buses arrived. Anyway, it was totally worth it since morning sun was creating an amazing atmosphere inside! Trees are inseparable elements of the temples, they are both destroying and holding together the whole complex at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enormous trees and jungle surroundings makes this place one of Angkor's most popular temples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angkor Wat is a huge archaeological site where between famous temples you can find many restaurants but also small villages with traditional houses and local markets. We decided to check few temples further away from the main site which are less known to the public: Banteay Samre, Lolei (in scaffold!), Preah Koh and Bakong. It took us quite long to get there following the main road full of trucks. I really dislike those unhealthy fumes and didn’t feel very safe in our tuk-tuk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a three day pass, an great alternative after seeing both the grand and petit circuit is to rent mountain bikes and explore hidden paths and small temples inside the main Angkor archaeological park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Cambodia/AngkorWat/DSC02848.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Quite empty Banteay Samre temple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;While passing the small villages between the temples we noticed many stalls with wicker items and characteristic red portable fridges. Each of the contains treasures, ice with cold sodas and water inside :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Our tuk-tuk driver stopped here to get some petrol :O Usually you can buy a petrol from a plastic bottle next to the road so that one was pretty advanced station :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While visiting Angkor Wat archaeological park you can buy interesting handmade craft (e.g. water colored paintings of monks), plenty of souvenirs, snacks, beverages, hire a guide, photographer or just simply explore ruins until you drop :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city itself did not impress us so much (besides the food! It impressed us so much I’ll write a separate post about it). Exclusive hotels and restaurants, many shops, cheap souvenirs and famous Pub Street where you can buy cheap drinks. Good vibes in the city are missing. We did like the small restaurants and market with handmade items where I bought mix of spices to prepare ourselves a famous amok soup :) We noticed in the city decorations for their New Year celebration started to appear. Yeap, at that moment we realized we are going to celebrate this event in Laos in less than two weeks! :O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Fish Pedicure :) Some would say a kind of a massage but not for people who get tickled easily (so me), then it is torture! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siem Reap was our last stop in Cambodia and the cheapest city in this country. Great number of tourists triggered fierce competition and this is driving prices down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuk-tuk in the city - 1$ per 2km (using PassApp)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renting a bike - 2$ (mountain bike, 5$) / day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 day ticket to Angkor Wat - 62 $/person (allowing you to enter 3 times within 7 days), a photo of your face will be taken at the counter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cotton t-shirt - 2$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lunch around Ta Phrom - 4$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big bottle of cold water - 1$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three fridge magnets bought next to one of the temples - 1$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuk-tuk sunrise at Angkor Wat plus small circuit - 20$ (around 8h)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuk-tuk to temples beyond the grand circuit of the main site - 22$ (around 6h)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bus ticket Phnom Penh to Siem Reap - 15$ &lt;a href=&quot;http://giantibis.com/&quot;&gt;Giant Ibis&lt;/a&gt;, we were pleasantly surprised by the standard of our bus and the quality of the service! The only time we had seat belts, working wifi, were offered snacks/refreshments and got information in English about breaks and duration of a journey, excellent job :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
