Monika and Sebastian, a Polish-Belgian couple that recently moved to the beautiful city of Leuven 
(Belgium) after living in marvelous Potsdam (Germany) the last 4 years. We both love to travel 
(especially when it includes hiking) and to embrace new experiences and challenges ðŸ™‚

We started traveling together in 2014, an have visited many cities in Belgium 
(Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent) and Poland (Warsaw, WrocÅ‚aw, PoznaÅ„, Krakow, MiÄ™dzyzdroje, 
Zakopane). Every year we also aim to go for a longer hiking trip! So far we visited Morocco, 
Iceland, Georgia and most recently the Himalayas. We also discovered the beauty of the Karkonosze 
and Tatras mountain-ranges in Poland along with the Alps in Bergamo, Italy. We challeng ourselves 
to do different running competitions like half-marathons and obstacle runs (including the Iron 
Viking, which claims to be the worlds toughest marathon). On the top of than we did many weekend 
trips in Europe (Cambridge, Barcelona, Leipzig, Hamburg).

This year, we decided to use few months of break between moving to Belgium and switching jobs to 
discover Southeast Asia. Our journey began with a month in Singapore, where we experienced 
tropical temperatures and stunning, extraordinary architecture. This was for us like a city from 
the future. After a short stay in Europe, we headed to Nepal and finished the Annapurna circuit 
in the Himalayas. We could not imagine a trip without some exhausting hiking among the highest 
peaks in the world. Then we started a search for mysterious temples in Cambodia, Laos and 
Thailand.
